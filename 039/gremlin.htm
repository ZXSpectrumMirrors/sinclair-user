<h1><i>The world is your lobster</i></h1>

<p class="first">THE MAN himself was there at the launch of Minder, the DK'tronics/Thames TV spinoff. <b>Arthur Daley</b> spent much of the time smoking cigars and munching biscuits, however. Programmer <b>Don Priestley</b> did most of the talking.</p>

<p>That clearly worried the DK'tronics heavies, who lacked confidence in the garrulous pensioner. The minders stood at the back making signs to Priestley, in an attempt to guide his replies.</p>

<p>In any case the black box fatties needn't have worried. Most of the questions were bawled out by an imposing female from the <i>Daily Mirror</i>. &quot;Everyone knows you have to get a game into the arcades to make any money,&quot; she insisted, asking if <b>Minder</b> was &quot;the new Pac Man.&quot; &quot;Is it a battle game or what?&quot; ranted this refugee from a Surrey gymkhana. Nice to know the <i>Daily Maxwell</i> still has a finger on the pulse of Britain ...</p>

<h2>DK vendetta</h2>

<p class="first">Meanwhile, <b>DK'tronics</b> is suffering from the attentions of an ex-employee with a grudge. The character has been sending out press releases on photocopied DK'tronics notepaper delving into owner <b>David Heelas'</b> private life.</p>

<p>Without going into the gory and irrelevant details, it appears David made a court appearance recently at which he announced he was selling the company and moving to Great Yarmouth. Not so, according to <b>DK</b>. Which leaves Gremlin pondering two questions. Who is penning the poisonous press releases, and why did Heelas tell a court he was selling up if he wasn't?</p>

<h2>Garbo on the Mersey</h2>

<p class="first"><b>Software Projects</b> superstar <b>Matthew Smith</b> is 'resting', according to his boss <b>Alan Maton</b>. The flabby maestro of animated toilets is distressed by the attention of the media and only vants to be alone ...</p>

<h2>Rivers of blood</h2>

<p class="first">Meanwhile, <b>Maton</b> is scouring Liverpool for someone to throttle. He's convinced a fellow Merseysider is behind rumours that Software Projects is going bust. &quot;I'll punch him in the head, I'll *@#!~&#163; kick his teeth in, I'll ...&quot; Words fail Alan as visions of blood-soaked slaughter fill his brain ...</p>

<h2>The wrath of Buzby</h2>

<p class="first">Incensed by a derogatory news item about <b>Gyron</b> in a rival comic, creators <b>Firebird</b> promptly threatened to withdraw 10 grand's worth of advertising if the subsequent review spat similar vitriol.</p>

<p>The rag in question, a slim publication catering mainly for the headbanger market, now features no review at all ...</p>

<h2>Kid's stuff</h2>

<p class="first">Brazen Backslappers of the Month Award goes to <b>Elite</b> for emphasising the extreme youth of the company. There are several extreme youths at Elite, and sales director <b>Steve Wilcox</b> reckons it means Elite is &quot;meeting the needs of a young market - average age 10 to 15.&quot;</p>

<p>A long list of games is included, such as <b>Grand National</b> and <b>Dukes of Hazzard</b>. The one the Wilcox clan omits is <b>911TS</b>, an incredibly dull plug for Dunlop Tyres. Word from the kindergarten suggests the little lads are unhappy about the game. &quot;Definitely the last of a breed,&quot; says one pre-pubescent mole ...</p>

<h2><a name="reagan">Nuking US Gold</a></h2>

<p class="first"><b>CND</b> is worried about games like <b>Raid Over Moscow</b> where zapping aliens is discarded for the joys of nuking the reds.</p>

<p>Gremlin cherishes the comments of <b>US Gold's Geoff Brown</b>, who brought the venomous game to our shores. &quot;A well-adjusted child is able to differentiate fantasy from reality,&quot; he says. Quite. It's not the kids who worry us, it's what happens when they grow up and turn into Ronald Reagan ...</p>

<h2>Political virgin</h2>

<p class="first"><b>Nick Alexander</b> of <b>Virgin</b> is also getting into politics. 32-year-old Nick has been co-opted to advise <b>David Owen</b> of the <b>SDP</b> about the interests of youth. Nick is a proud founder member of the SDP and reckons his experience flogging records and <b>Sheepwalk</b> to kids will stand Dr Owen in good stead. The facts speak for themselves, really ...</p>

<h2>Old buffer complains</h2>

<p class="first">And finally <b>Mike Howard</b> of <b>Buffer Micro</b> (RIP) writes elsewhere to protest about Gremlin's hairy armpits story last month. Since the sexist comments were taken from an article written under his name in a trade paper, it seems odd.</p>

<p>According to Howard, the <i>Computer Trade Weekly</i> gang made it all up, and then read bits of it to him over the phone. &quot;If Howard wanted any of it changed he could have said so,&quot; wails cub reporter Simon Harvey at CTW. &quot;I did,&quot; says Howard. &quot;They wanted to make a crack about Greenham Common, and I said no. So they put in hairy armpits instead, which was even worse.&quot;</p>

<p>CTW says that it has a duty to report the industry 'warts and all'. And if you can't find any warts, invent them, supposes Gremlin ...</p>
