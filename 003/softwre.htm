<h1>Scoring with bridge players</h1>

<p class="first">FROM the newly-formed Dunrobin Software, a bridge scorepad is claimed to be flexible and comprehensive. It is menu-driven and is said to be crashproof, with easy-to-follow instructions.</p>

<p>The pad includes a scoreboard, with automatic scoring of doubles, re-doubles, honours and so on, a history page detailing each hand played, a statistics page, and the ability to save the details for later study.</p>

<p>The names of teams are restricted to 14 letters and if stakes are not to be played for, a 0 should be entered at the 'pence/00' prompt. To prevent the program crashing it ignores impossible inputs and awaits a valid reply. It is also possible to reject valid inputs after the bid entry routine, in case a mistake has been made.</p>

<p>Each cassette, which costs &#163;4.95, contains two copies of the program and has a full list of instructions.</p>

<p>It was written by John Williamson and is available from Dunrobin Software at West Lothian.</p>

<h2>Toolkit routines</h2>

<p class="first">A CASSETTE with a series of routines is provided by IRS Software under the title Toolkit. For &#163;3.95, eight routines can assist in the writing of programs.</p>

<p>All are written in machine code and take up only 164 bytes of RAM and are put in the high end of the storage to avoid being over-written by users' programs. They are for use with the 16K RAM pack and include four general routines, three graphics routines and a tape routine.</p>

<p>They can be used by adding the instructions as commands.</p>

<p>A more expensive version, at &#163;4.95, includes other routines, plus GO TOs and GO SUBs in the line re-number.</p>

<p>Toolkit is available from IRS Software at Worthing, Sussex.</p>

<h2>Original graphics</h2>

<p class="first">MACRONICS has developed what it claims is an original technique for the production of high-resolution graphics. For &#163;3.95 it is possible to save and reload pictures on cassette but it cannot be listed on the ZX printer.</p>

<p>Large pictures can be created by dispensing with the normal character set and setting-up a system which needs following carefully to ensure that mistakes are not made.</p>

<p>It can be supplied in a package of four programs costing &#163;7.95. All are available from Macronics Systems at Solihull, West Midlands.</p>

<h2>1K games bargain</h2>

<p class="first">ELEVEN GAMES in one pack for &#163;6 must be a bargain and as they all fit into 1K of the ZX-81 they are ideal for the person who has just bought the machine.</p>

<img src="softwre1.gif" width=142 height=275 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="left" alt="Space Pirate">

<p>The games have to be simple to fit into the space but most are interesting and give a good guide to the possibilities of the ZX-81. There is a good variety with names like <b>Man-eating budgies, Space Pirate, The Wall</b> and <b>Maze</b>.</p>

<p>Attempts to play the games in sequence require stopping the cassette as soon as it has loaded but if only one game is required that can be done easily.</p>

<p>The pack is available from Artic Computing at Hull, North Humberside.</p>

<h2>Calculation workhorse</h2>

<p class="first">CALCUSLAVE is described as a calculation workhorse for the ZX-81. According to its inventor, the secret of the program lies in the superb string-handling and slicing capabilities of the ZX-81 with the data being held in strings.</p>

<p>It can be used for a wide range of repetitive calculations which do not need a database. The only limit is that any calculation cannot be more than 18 characters long, but within that there is a wide range of possibilities, including personal accounts, income tax, physics problems and VAT.</p>

<p>The program has five expressions but users car put in their own calculations. A knowledge of Basic is not needed to do that, so long as the detailed instructions are followed.</p>

<p>If used with a ZX printer an automatic copy of all calculations is provided.</p>

<p>It takes up 14K of memory and costs &#163;4.95. It is produced as part of a new range of software by Softouch of Cambridgeshire.</p>

<h2>Recording holidays</h2>

<p class="first">A SYSTEM has been produced to provide management information on holidays and sickness for small businesses. Running on the ZX-81 with the 16K RAM pack, it will handle up to 80 records.</p>

<p>The holiday version compares leave entitlement to the number of days taken and will print a list of people with more than a set amount of leave not yet taken. The sick leave system records and prints the names of people with more than a set amount of time off sick.</p>

<p>Both systems are available on one cassette costing &#163;9.95 from Computator, Greenwich, London.</p>
