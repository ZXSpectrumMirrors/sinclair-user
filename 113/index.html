<p class="first"><b>Garth Sumpter</b><br>
Garth has been suffering from a slight personality disorder this month. Wavering somewhere between Jim Morrison and Paul &quot;Hustler&quot; Newman, Garth has been seen haunting the dark recesses of the pool halls singing old Doors tracks. With his dark glasses, simulated leather cowboy boots and black jacket it could be Roy Orbison spinning the black off the cushion into the top pocket. After all, he's got more chance of winning a game than Garth!<br>

<p class="first"><b>Alan Dykes</b><br>
There's a new kid in town and his name's Alan. The big guy created quite a smash with the crew on a recent ten-pin bowling outing. Winning almost every game, Garth decided he had to be stopped and topped up the finger holes of Alan's ball with a bottle of baby oil that he just happened to have on his person. As Alan swung back for his shot the 20lb ball flew backwards copping Garth right in his smug mug. &quot;Hurrah!&quot; cried the crew.&quot;Oops!&quot; mumbled Alan, &quot;who put out the lights!&quot;<br>

<p class="first"><b>Yvette Nichols</b><br>
Come 5.30 pm Friday night Yvette belts out of the door in Bermuda shorts screaming &quot;&quot;Can't stop dudes! Surf's up!&quot; Beach Bunny Yvette doesn't get much chance to catch the waves or wax her stick in the Metropolis so she has to hang a tube at home with an old ironing board balanced on top of a biscuit tin. For added effect she places a high powered fan in front of her and covers the floor with wrinkled cling film. Now that's what I call improvisation!<br>

Fresh face Tony's the office girlie's pin-up of the week. Turning heads and breaking hearts all over the building. Tone has, quote &quot;No probs wiv da women&quot; but he looks so young and innocent every girl he goes out with has to get his mum's permission first!<br>

Busier than a Shire horse with a Pit Bull Terrier in its underpants, Steve has moved house three times this month., been to four parties, five pub openings and fifty three official lager tastings and he has still managed to bang out almost a full page of copy for SU. How does he do it? Garth only knows - we think he's moonlighting for Brewers Annually, thus named because a years research goes into each and every issue. (Waszat supoz ta mean, hic! - Steve)<br>

In her quest for stardom Andrea has been doing the gig circuit this month. Hanging out with the stars at the bars and avoiding the paparazzi who can be seen following her around in droves as she tries to hide her head under her tattered security blanket. Well that's who she says they are, but a little bird tells me that this story's full of wind as the men actually work for the gas board and she hasn't paid her bill!<br>

It's always difficult life - especially if you're a teenager. I mean, did you know that teenagers worry more about problems than any other part of society? To this end, we'll be introducing Andrea's Problem Spot next month, so if you've got any teenage problems then just drop her a line.
