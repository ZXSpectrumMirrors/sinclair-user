<p class="first"><b><font size="-1">Hiya hackers everywhere. I just thought that this would be a good time to explain what's going on with SU at the moment. You see, with the Spectrum software industry releasing very little new software at the time of writing, we thought we'd reduce the size of SU by a few pages and give you all the benefit in the form of super-packed tapes!</font></b></p>

<p class="first"><b><font size="-1">Here at SU Towers, the SU Crew think that full games, pokes, tips and utilities are better value than three or four demos and a couple of games, but just let us know if we're wrong. After all, at the end of the day, we have to answer to you, the readers. So if you have any views on the subject then write to me at Garth's Corner. I'd like to know what you think. Cheers!</font></b></p>

Returning fresh faced after a week skiing in France Andrea found her desk in better condition than she left 'La Planya', thanks to the Crew who got together and trod precariously through the piles of rubbish inhabiting her domain. Our thanks were short and sweet, &quot;If I don't find that A4 picture of Mel Gibson you're all dead!&quot;<br>

<p class="first"><b>Tony Naqvi</b><br>
Tony &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot; Naqvi fits in well on the SU Crew bench. Our Tony is a closet Frasher and that's alright by us. It took Garth back to his hippy days when he was appearing in a Hellman's Mayonnaise advert set in medieval England and trying to get lead breaks out of a 12th century lute. Tony's now finished his stint on the SU Crew but we think we may be seeing more of him in the future (as long as he turns down the volume of Iron Maiden when the MD's about!)<br>

Totally busy this month, Chris is now known as Mr Flash around the office. The only man, and I use that term very loosely, on the planet who can do a week's work before he wakes up and a month's work before he goes to sleep! This amazing lifestyle has enabled Chris to amass a huge personal fortune with which he plans to take over SU and buy a lot of shares in Bassett's Jelly Babies.<br>

What a month it's been for our intrepid Ed. Working like a dog for issue 111 he's so shagged out now that he's beginning to bark. Although it could be something to do with the fact that last week (so he says) he was accidentally, so the story goes when he tells it, locked in the next door pub all night. Being a member of Alcoholics Ubiquitous, he thought it his duty to relieve the pub of all liquid beverages. Needless to say, when the pub was unlocked in the morning, Garth did not so much as walk, as spill out on to the pavement!<br>

Little is known of Steve - the man behind the hairstyle is only known for his extensive repertoire of horrific puns and gaudy habit of wearing petruli oil. Always the rocker, Steve arrives each day at SU Towers at 9.28 am - dropped off at the door by a gang of greasy, knuckle-dragging bikers on chrome-wheeled, fuel injected, silver dream machines. It's OK for some, eh?<br>
