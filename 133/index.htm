<p class="first">The Fun 4 is really a Fun 5 this month but we're being modest as usual. There's shoot 'em up action in the tradition of Harrier Attack with our attack helicopter full game <b>ATAC</b>, a multi level, horizontally scrolling SU Exclusive. The action continues in adventure land for those brave enough to face it (and to finish last month's instalment) with the third part of <b>The Axe Of Kolt</b>, while for those needing help with the first two parts we've included help. Dinosaur mania hits SU in the form of a brief history lesson, <b>Dinosaurs</b> ... Brush up your knowledge of these prehistoric monsters. And finally <b>Pokemania</b>, your monthly games help clinic. Oh yes, we almost forgot there's a <b>Music Demo</b> too!</p>

Garth Sumpter has become so cool that we all have to wear woolly jumpers when he's around. Luckily he's a square and this month displays his talents by extorting an excellent map and solution for Crystal Kingdom Dizzy from two hapless readers who haven't, and are highly unlikely to, ever meet each other or him. Among other gems of information ...</p>

<p class="first"><b>ALAN DYKES</b><br>
Big Al' has gone completely out of his tiny little mind this month. For a start he's desperately heartbroken at the sudden departure of Yvette Nichols (a year late) to New Zealand. But even worse he also thinks he's Guile out of Street Fighter 2, which is a bit sad 'cos he looks more like E. Honda. (Who wrote this? They're fired!)</p></td>

<p class="first"><b>SARA PRUCE</b><br>
Whooa! We've got a new girlie art editor up in SU Towers, Sara Pruce. It's a hard job filling Yvette's shoes but Sara who is roughly the same size fits the bill marvelously. Her fave occupations are telling Big Al' off (she learns quickly)and going to raves. Her fave games are shoot 'em ups 'cos she's tough she is!</p></td>

<p class="first"><b>YVETTE NICHOLS</b><br>
Boo hoo, it's time to wish a tearful bye bye to the top designer and SU pin up from the southern hemisphere, Yvette 'Scalpel' Nichols. She's packing it all in to go home to New Zealand, learn more about sheep and light aircraft, and get back to were the surf never sets. Bye Yvette we'll all miss you. (Good that's got rid of her.)</p></td>

Garth has a completely new image these days - thanks to a few visits to Paris and a
Christmas/New Year holiday spent in a tiny cottage in the Lake District with five Scandinavian supermodels. He wears dark glasses and tuxedos to work, smokes French cigarettes and eats caviar. It's a pity about the Brummie accent though.</p></td>

<p class="first"><b>PHILIP LINDEY</b><br>
What? Another departing member of the SU Crew? Well, yes actually. Philip has bummed off to the green pastures of old Ireland to live in a cottage and paint highly artistic representations of certain species of flora and fauna in various states of undress. Parting comment: 'God it's good to get away from all my admiring fans, keep on Speccing folks'!</p></td>

Steve 'Ken, Ryu, Guile, Honda, Chun Li, Bison, Dhalsim, etc.' Keen has just been voted the world's most influential authority on Street Fighter 2. He can't actually play it to save his life but he theoretically knows more tricks, moves and slick, surefire ways to win than anyone else on the planet.</p></td>
