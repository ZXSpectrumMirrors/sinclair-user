<h1>Sinclair acts to improve the standard of its named software</h1>

<p class="first"><b><font size="+1">John Gilbert looks at the latest group of cassettes issued by Sinclair and finds that it is now setting the standards</font></b></p>

<p class="first">A NEW BATCH of Sinclair Research software for the ZX-81 and Spectrum shows a marked improvement in the quality of programs and a continuation of fine artwork on the cassette inserts.</p>

<p>The reason is that the company is selling programs from other independent companies, such as Melbourne House and Artic, instead of continuing to rely on Psion, Mikro-Gen and ICL.</p>

<p><b>The Hobbit</b> takes first place in the new releases for quality and value for money. This adventure game, which the makers claim uses artificial intelligence, is discussed in <a href="mindgms.htm">Mind Games.</a></p>

<p><b>Vu-3D</b>, for the 48K Spectrum, is another good offering from Psion. It allows the user to create a three-dimensional representation of an object on the television screen. The object can then be rotated and viewed from any angle. The objects can be displayed as wirework figures or can be shaded. They can also be magnified and reduced.</p>

<p>It is possible to store the figure on tape in a data file and re-load it to view again. The program costs &#163;9.95 but even though it has some good features it still seems over-priced.</p>

<img src="ssoft2.jpg" width=125 height=200 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="right" alt="Ship of Doom">
<p>Games feature strongly in the new tapes. Sinclair is selling the Artic range of adventures, A, C and D. Adventure A works on the 16K or 48K Spectrum and 16K ZX-81 and is called <b>Planet of Death</b>.</p>

<p>You are stranded on a planet and must return to your spaceship. There is no guide to the keywords but with a little thought you can discover the help command. At times the suggestions can be very unhelpful and it is a good idea to construct a map, as some of the help suggestions may make you retrace your footsteps.</p>

<p>The next adventure so far released is C, called <b>Ship of Doom</b>. It can be run on the 48K Spectrum and 16K ZX-81.</p>

<p>Your ship is captured by aliens who are searching for humanoids to replace their brains with microchips. The object of the game is to escape from the alien craft by breaking the gravitational field. To do so you must find the control room of the alien ship.</p>

<p>The help command is a little more useful in this game and it is easier to get further when first playing the game.</p>

<p>Adventure D, called <b>Espionage Island</b>, can be used on the 48K Spectrum or 16K ZX-81. You must escape from an aircraft which is about to crash into the Atlantic. You must then reach the island safely, avoid capture, and try to discover the secret of the island. The game is more difficult than the others and many people have not managed to get out of the aircraft, even though there is a parachute. All the adventures cost &#163;6.95.</p>

<img src="ssoft3.jpg" width=125 height=200 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="left" alt="1K ZX Chess">
<p>Leaving adventure games, <b>Reversi</b>, or <b>Othello</b> as it is sometimes called, can be played on the 16K Spectrum or 16K ZX-81. The game has nine levels, from novice to expert, and the computer is difficult to beat. The makers claim that Reversi reflects the strict contemporary morality of Victorian society but we believe that it can be traced to Arabic origins. Reversi costs &#163;7.95.</p>

<p>An interesting addition to the range of software is the Artic <b>1K Chess</b>. It takes some technical wizardry to squeeze this kind of game into the unexpanded ZX-81.</p>

<p>The game can be played using one of two opening moves. Because of the lack of memory, castling, pawn promotion and capturing en passant are not allowed. The game loads in approximately 40 seconds and that is ideal for someone who wants a quick game of chess without having to load from a tape which takes several minutes.</p>

<p>The computer also makes its moves very fast for the amount of memory available to it. 1K Chess costs &#163;4.95.</p>

<p><b>Super Glooper</b> is an amusing game of Pac-man on the 16K ZX-81. Glooper must paint the maze before the aliens kill him. Unfortunately it is difficult to evade those aliens using the standard ZX-81 keyboard but it is not impossible. Glooper can also pick up one of the shields at the corners of the maze to protect himself and chase the aliens.</p>

<p>On the other side of the tape is <b>Frogs</b>, a game of Frogger. You must get the frogs over the river via the moving boats to the jetties on the other bank. If froggie falls into the river, it drowns.</p>

<p>You score points for each frog you get across the river and you can have eight frogs to send to their deaths. Super Glooper and Frogs cost &#163;4.95.</p>

<img src="ssoft4.jpg" width=125 height=200 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="right" alt="1K Games">
<p>Another game with a familiar-sounding theme is <b>Through the Wall</b>. It is based on Breakout and is available for the 16K ZX-81. On the other side of the cassette is <b>Scramble</b>, also a familiar theme. Both games on one cassette represent good value at &#163;4.95.</p>

<p>A package for the 1K ZX-81, called <b>1K Games</b>, has also been released. The games include <b>Jackpot</b>, in which you must try to win the 25 pence jackpot from a one-armed bandit; <b>Etch and Sketch</b>, where you can draw pictures on the screen; and <b>Maze Game</b>, where you must find your way out of the conventional maze.</p>

<p>The release of this cassette, costing &#163;4.95, is a good idea at a time when so many people are buying ZX-81s.</p>

<p>A basic <b>Toolkit</b> is available for the 16K ZX-81. It provides a series of machine code routines to make the job of programming easier. It includes a re-number routine, a search and replace routine, a merge routine to put together two separate Basic programs, and a routine to put a Basic program above RAMTOP and out of the way of the NEW command. The Toolkit costs &#163;5.95.</p>

<img src="ssoft5.jpg" width=125 height=200 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="left" alt="Inca Curse">
<p>Two database programs are available in the range for the 48K Spectrum. They are called <b>Collector's Pack</b> and <b>Club Record Controller</b>.</p>

<p>Collector's Pack can be used to store information about coins, stamps or even records. The Club Record Controller will store information about people, such as addresses and telephone numbers. It would be useful to schools or even someone who runs a private club. Both packages are easy to use and cost &#163;9.95.</p>

<p><b>Adventure B, Inca Curse</b>, for the 48K Spectrum is an upgrade of an adventure which Artic wrote for the 16K ZX-81. The adventurer is exploring in the jungle when he finds an Inca temple. The aim is to go in and drag out all the treasure, or as much as you can carry. It all seems so easy until you enter the game and step into the temple.</p>

<p>The authors have managed to cram a good deal into this adventure and the Artic top score of 3,200 points will take some beating. We must admit that it is not one of the adventures in which we have made much progress. Adventure B costs &#163;6.95.</p>

<p>The latest release of tapes is certainly better than the previous one. The games, utility, and business areas have been covered well but there is still a lack of good educational software. The only tapes available tend to be multi-choice and question-and-answer sessions.</p>

<p>The Psion tapes seem to be the best for quality at the moment and the ones with the most interesting concepts. None of the cassettes reviewed was bad but The Hobbit, Vu-3D, 1K Chess, and Super Glooper seem best.</p>
