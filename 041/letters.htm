<h1>Putting Denton's record straight</h1>

<p class="first">HAVING read <a href="../040/htsquad.htm">the article about Denton Designs</a> in your July issue, there are a few points I would like to make.</p>

<p>Firstly, in 12 months, with a quarter of Imagine's programming staff, they have produced more and better products than Imagine did in it's last 12 months. This would seem to indicate that when at Imagine they were grossly mismanaged, and/or working for themselves has spurred them to greater productivity.</p>

<p>Secondly, whilst I appreciate Steve Cain saying that I have calibre, I do not understand his reference to 'cock ups'. At Imagine I was in charge of sales and marketing, which are generally regarded as having been Imagine's strengths. Denton does not have sales or marketing because they recognise their lack of ability in these areas; that is why Beyond and Ocean do it for them. Steve Cain is not qualified to pass comment on my skills, just as I am not on his skills.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is refreshing to find that Denton Designs has inherited Imagine's lack of false modesty.</p>

<p>To conclude, I wish Denton Designs and all who work there, the best for the future. Their skills and originality are what this market needs and make a happy change from the plagiarized junk produced by many people.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Bruce Everiss, Merseyside</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>The comments made by Steve Cain of Denton Designs in respect of Bruce Everiss's capabilities as a sales and marketing director are not endorsed by the editorial staff of</i> Sinclair User. <i>We apologise to Bruce Everiss for any inconvenience and embarrassment caused.</i></p>

<p class="first">I HAVE just read <a href="../040/htsquad.htm">the Hit Squad interview with Denton Designs</a> July 1985. I believe the paragraph detailing programs written by Denton Designs to be misleading.</p>

<p>In the list of games given you include <b>World Series Baseball</b>. The Spectrum version of the game was not written by Denton Designs, but by Platinum Productions for Imagine '85, which is owned by Ocean.</p>

<p class="first"><b>David Anderson, Platinum Productions</b></p>

<h2>Rating scores no points</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE always relied on the Gilbert factor when buying a game. Now I find you have changed to star ratings. Gilberts are much better, please bring them back.</p>

<p>As to David J Anderson's totally despicable letter against women reviewing games - May 1985. Your interviews have not been 'scraping the barrel' although I would like to see an ACG interview.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Max Schaefer</b></p>

<h2>Lampooning a copyright</h2>

<p class="first">LET US hope your comments - <a href="../040/advent.htm">Adventure, July</a> - concerning the copyright hassles that Delta 4 hope to avoid by 'changing the names and aims' in their game <b>Bored of the Rings</b> are well founded.</p>

<p>I feel sure that some of the Harvard Lampoon team which published the original <i>Bored of the Rings</i> might recognise the work as a copy of their own.</p>

<p>I look forward to being informed that (a) it is all Delta 4's work and coincidences do happen; (b) it was an oversight and they thought the book would be mentioned: (c) you enjoyed reading the book; or (d) who cares what the yanks think and I can take a running jump.</p>

<p class="first"><b>P J Bird</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>The correct answer is (d). The game is a spoof of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings with all names and places changed and not a copy of the American book. Apparently, the title is not copyright.</i></p>

<h2>Take up thy C5 and run</h2>

<p class="first">I WOULD like to reply to J Talbot and J Paton - <a href="../039/letters.htm">June, letters</a> - who criticised my earlier letter about the C5. I can't believe J Paton stating that the lack of cycle paths is to blame. You don't build an aeroplane and wait for someone to build a runway!</p>

<p>The C5 is also too easy to steal. All you have to do is hop in and off you go. If you want a faster getaway then try picking it up and running with it under your arm.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Dietmar Osman</b></p>

<h2>Take two for a Tasword count</h2>

<p class="first">I WAS interested in your article Customising your Word Processor, May, <i>Sinclair User</i>.</p>

<p>I attempted to introduce into my Tasword the Word Count, resulting in a crashed program.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Philip Muston</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>THE MOST common problem with the Word Count routine is once you have saved the code to tape you should load Tasword, add the additional Basic and enter CLEAR 31940 as a direct command before loading the word code. To call the routine RUN Tasword, go to the STOP menu and press W.</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>TO display the word count option in the menu, alter lines 25 to 80. Those vary according to which version you own.</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>The header, in listing 4, should be put in line 270 with the REM removed and the REM in line 294 should be removed to print the footer.</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>In line 220 the FN in the second statement is a Keyword, reached by going into E mode, holding symbol shift and pressing 2. For clarity you could also alter the middle of line 200 to read:</i></p>

<pre>LET a$= &quot;Text Lines per Page (&quot;;PEEK 31940;&quot;)&quot;:</pre>

<h2>No peace study bias</h2>

<p class="first">I AM disappointed by two things in your June issue which seem based on ill-considered statements.</p>

<p>The first was the inference by <a href="../039/gremlin.htm#reagan">Gremlin</a> that Ronald Reagan is about to start a nuclear war. Surely that is too trite.</p>

<p>More serious was <a href="../039/sftwrea.htm#worldwise">Theo Wood's claim</a> about peace studies. What is 'unbiased' about teachers wearing CND badges while teaching the so called peace lessons?</p>

<p>I am pro Mr Reagan and Mrs Thatcher but would not seek to dismiss their opponents with a couple of off-the-cuff remarks.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Michael J King</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>Theo Wood did not use the word 'unbiased' and made no references to CND badge-carrying teachers. She did, however, say that the program &quot;is informative without being biased.&quot;</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>Gremlin made no such inference about Reagan's itchy trigger finger. Your right-wing paranoia is obviously working overtime, Ed.</i></p>
