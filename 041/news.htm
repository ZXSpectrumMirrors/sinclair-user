<h1>Clive - in good hands?</h1>

<p class="first">ENERGETIC entrepreneur Robert Maxwell has jumped in where the City fears to tread and has bought a controlling share of Sinclair Research. The deal gives Maxwell, millionaire owner of the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, 75 per cent of the shares in return for &#163;12m cash. That money is required to pay off Timex, Thorn EMI and Sinclair's bankers.</p>

<p>Sir Clive himself retains about eight per cent of the company, and the title of life president, but he no longer has a seat on the board. Instead, he has a five year contract as technical consultant, to head research and development at the company. The C5 company, Sinclair Vehicles, is not involved in the deal.</p>

<p>Sinclair Research has been drifting towards the rocks for months, following gross over-production at Christmas. That left the company with over &#163;30m of stocks, many of which are thought to be QLs.</p>

<p>Robert Maxwell appears to have bought himself a bargain; only a year ago Sinclair Research was valued at &#163;100m. His first task will be to find a new chief executive, to replace Sir Clive.</p>

<p>As for Sir Clive, he claims to be happy about the situation. He says his new position as life president is 'grandiose but meaningless' and stresses that all planned new products will continue to be developed 'as before'. It is difficult to believe that he feels no distress at all at losing control of his company, but he has always claimed to have no interest in financial matters or indeed personal wealth, and as such may welcome the opportunity to spend more time in the laboratory.</p>

<p>&quot;We welcome Maxwell with open arms,&quot; says Joe Woods, marketing manager for Terry Blood, the sole UK distributor of Sinclair hardware. &quot;It's the best thing that could have happened to the industry and to Sinclair. The company needed to be managed in a much more professional way and you can't get much more professional than Robert Maxwell.&quot;</p>

<p>Woods confirms that the current distribution deal, which runs into 1986, still stands, and that Terry Blood continues to be 'fully involved with Sinclair Research.'</p>

<p>Maxwell may not find life on the high-tech seas all plain sailing, however. Acorn, which was bailed out by Olivetti five months ago for a similar sum, has once again asked that its shares be suspended, this time at 11 pence. The &#163;12m pumped in has apparently gone.</p>

<p>The success of Sinclair Research, therefore, must depend on new products, if current sales are falling. Its earlier glories came about through taking tremendous risks where conventional business thought scorned the whole concept of mass home computing.</p>

<p>Whether Maxwell is prepared to back such risks with hard cash in future developments is a question which will continue to exercise the industry for many, many months to come.</p>

<h2>Who is Robert Maxwell?</h2>

<img src="news2.jpg" width=100 height=114 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="right" alt="Maxwell">
<p class="first">ROBERT MAXWELL, the new owner of Sinclair Research, is one of the most colourful figures in the British business world. Born in Czechoslovakia in 1923, he was captured by the Nazis during the invasion of France in 1940. He escaped, and fled to Britain, where he joined the army and later took part in the liberation of Europe in 1944.</p>

<p>He has no formal education, and his main company, Pergamon Press, was founded in 1951. From seven publications, Pergamon is now a large company with over 6000 books.</p>

<p>Apart from Sinclair Research and Pergamon, he also owns BPCC, a major printing works, and recently bought the Mirror Group of newspapers as well as Oxford United Football Club.</p>

<p>Politically, Maxwell identifies himself with the Labour party, and was MP for Buckingham for six years. He is still a member of the party, although a controversial one.</p>

<p>Maxwell regards his acquisition of both Sinclair and the Mirror Group as patriotic enterprises, as well as sound business investments. In the football arena he had to settle for Oxford United, having failed to buy Manchester United.</p>

<p>He is also celebrated, or notorious, for the intense personal interest he takes in his companies. Fleet Street is full of tales, many no doubt embroidered, of the results of unexpected visits by a mackintoshed Maxwell to the <i>Mirror</i> offices. Although he does not hold the position of chief executive of Sinclair Research, as he does at the <i>Mirror</i>, there is no reason to doubt that Maxwell will stamp his personality on the company as forcefully as on other business ventures.</p>

<h2>Which report slams C5</h2>

<p class="first">A KIT to link two C5 batteries together is to be released by Sinclair Vehicles in response to criticism of the variable range of the machine. According to spokesman Bill Nichols, the kit will cost in the region of &#163;35.00, inclusive of the second battery.</p>


<p>A recent report by consumer organisation <i>Which?</i> criticised the C5 on range, speed and reliability. It suggested that those limitations did not compare favourably with a bicycle, given the price of the C5 - &#163;441.85 with the kit of extras.</p>

<center><table width="471" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr align="center"><td><img src="news3.gif" width=451 height=159 border=0 alt="Cartoon">
<br>
<p class="first"><b><font size="-1">C5 at twice the speed?</font></b></p>
</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>On safety, the report said it was difficult to see in traffic and the driver was vulnerable at bumper height. It did however praise the C5 as 'fun and free of fuss' in the current driving conditions.</p>

<p>Nichols says the speed is fixed by the law to allow drivers without insurance to use the vehicle. &quot;If we had produced a faster vehicle,&quot; he says, &quot;we would have produced other refinements as well. We claimed a range of up to 20 miles, not always that. Tests show the range to vary widely depending on traffic conditions, gradients, and road surface.&quot; He says the new battery kit should counter criticisms of range, and that Sinclair Vehicles was working on the battery and gearbox.</p>

<p>As for safety, he said there were no industry standards for the visibility of vehicles. Most organisations, such as the AA and Department of Transport, regarded the C5 as &quot;no less safe than a bicycle&quot;. Nichols stresses that so far only two accidents with C5s have occurred, neither, he claims, involving other vehicles and both &quot;induced by the driver, with no serious injury as a result.&quot;</p>

<h2>A Komplex solution</h2>

<p class="first">HALF-PRICED copies of <b>Komplex</b> are being offered to disenchanted owners of <b>The Great Space Race</b> by Software house Legend.</p>

<p>If purchasers send back the poster enclosed in the package to Legend, together with a cheque for &#163;4.95 they will receive a copy of <b>Komplex</b> in return.</p>

<p>Legend chairman John Peel is worried about the effect that TGSR has had on customer support for the company. &quot;We're making the offer because we feel that TGSR failed to live up to many people's expectations. The fact that we actually lost over &#163;200,000 on TGSR is not much consolation to people who bought the game and didn't like it. We take our customers seriously.&quot;</p>

<h2>Wafer-scale venture may boost Sinclair</h2>

<p class="first">THE WAFER-SCALE chip, which uses a four-inch disc of silicon to hold the equivalent power of hundreds of conventional chips, is almost set for production. Sir Clive Sinclair has announced the successful development of a technique for producing such chips at a cost and reliability rate which makes them viable for mass-production.</p>

<p>Metalab, the high-tech think tank set up by Sir Clive over a year ago for just such developments, appears to have succeeded first in a field where research has been going on for many years. A spokesman for Sinclair Research says the first wafer-scale product, a solid-state disc drive for the QL, is still on schedule for production later this year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, plans for a &#163;50m plant to exploit the new technology have been shelved by new owner Robert Maxwell. Instead, the company is looking for partners to help develop the new chip. Under the takeover deal, Sinclair Research retains the patent on the wafer-scale chip, but Sir Clive is to be allowed to continue private research on fifth generation computers, at his own expense.</p>

<p>In the event of Sir Clive's personal fortune being sufficient to sustain the necessary research, in an area where companies and governments are spending billions of dollars, Sinclair Research will have a first option on new products with Sir Clive retaining the patents.</p>

<p>Regardless of that, however, the new chip, if it lives up to the claims made, is a genuine technological breakthrough.</p>

<a name="spanish"><h2>The Spanish connection</h2></a>

<p class="first">A MAJOR international piracy operation, involving software from Britain's biggest software houses, has been uncovered.</p>

<p>Inforpress, a Spanish publishing company, produces a cassette magazine which provides its customers with 10 programs a month. Those pieces of software have included <b>Jet Set Willy</b> from Software Projects, <b>Danger Mouse in Double Trouble</b> from Creative Sparks and <b>Scuba Dive</b> from Durell Software. Other companies which have had software pirated by Inforpress are Gargoyle Games, Vortex, Mikro-Gen, Softek and Artic.</p>

<p>Mike Meek of Mikro-Gen says: &quot;We are sickened that the industry is being ripped off in this way. Recently I have been writing to magazines telling the people about our experiences of piracy and trying to get the trade to take note.&quot;</p>

<p>Some software houses are not so keen to pursue the issue as they believe nothing can be done about international piracy. A spokesman for Durell Software says: &quot;We have been ripped off in Spain so many times that we've lost count.&quot;</p>

<h2>Czech deal for Maxwell?</h2>

<p class="first">LARGE NUMBERS of Sinclair machines may soon find themselves behind the Iron Curtain. Sinclair Research has been trying to strike a major deal to supply computers to Eastern bloc countries for some months, and the recent relaxation of export regulations on hi-tech products removes one of the last hurdles.</p>

<p>The strategy has been endorsed by new owner Robert Maxwell who, born in Czechoslavakia, has strong business links with the Eastern bloc. He has decided to personally head the sales drive, and that added impetus may well tip the balance in favour of an advantageous deal.</p>

<p>The move is clearly an attractive way of clearing the &#163;30m stocks of unsold computers and televisions which brought Sinclair Research to its knees in the first place. Maxwell is not particularly worried about the silicon mountain he has acquired.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think the stocking is so horrendous,&quot; he says. &quot;We have a chance of selling some to the USSR and Bulgaria providing we don't break the rules.&quot;</p>

<p>The Russian market looks particularly attractive. The Soviet Government has grandiose plans to introduce computers into all its schools; a contract on that scale is surely a mouthwatering prospect for any home computer company.</p>

<h2>Kempston takes DOS for drive</h2>

<p class="first">MANUFACTURE of the SPDOS disc interface, and all other Spectrum Products, has been stopped by Watford Electronics. SPDOS is now produced by Kempston which has changed the name to KDOS.</p>

<p>Kempston has reconfigured the package and included a centronics and joystick port with the 8K ROM-based operating system. Also included is a utility which can transfer tape software to disc.</p>

<h2>Hackers in the dock</h2>

<p class="first">Robert Schifreen, 21 and Stephen Gold, 19 have been charged with a further nine counts under section 1 of the 1981 Forgery and Counterfeiting Act.</p>

<p>Appearing at Bow Street Magistrates Court on Jun 12 to answer two accusations, each involving alleged unauthorised entries into Prestel computers, the prosecution announced a further five charges against Schifreen and four against Gold.</p>

<p>Both men own Spectrum computers and were first arrested last March - see June's Sinclair User. Bow Street magistrate R Bartle again put the defendants on unconditional bail and remanded the case until July 4 to give the defence time to prepare its case.</p>
