# sinclair-user
This is the source for the sinclairuser.com web site - a site that transcribes articles from the British magazine Sinclair User which ran from 1982 to 1993.  It was originally run by Dave Forman but lapsed many years ago and was brought back to life and re-hosted.

If you wish to contribute please open a PR with any newly transcribed articles or features.  For structural work that affects many pages please open an issue to discuss first.
