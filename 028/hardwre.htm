<h1>Spectrum switches on for domestic duties</h1>

<p class="first">ONE OF the more unusual offerings from the Spectrum chain of shops is the Domestic Controller by Indescomp for the Spectrum. It is an I/O port with four relays built in and four input channels.</p>

<p>The relays can control low-powered equipment such as battery-powered devices or, for example, with the inputs as part of a burglar alarm circuit, the input detecting windows and doors being open and the output opening doors and turning lights on and off. Equally, users who are building a robot, with all its associated in/out requirements, will find it useful.</p>

<p>Each relay can switch up to one amp. No details of voltages are given and the input can detect a voltage of between 4.5V and 50V. Connections to the unit are by screw terminals and a LED is used to show which channels are in use.</p>

<p>To control the unit address 61441 is used, the lower four bits controlling the output and the upper four the input. With Issue 3 Spectrums, due to the changes, the input may vary by seven, i.e., the lower four bits, but a program is included to allow for that.</p>

<p>Other than that the unit is very easy to use, especially if you have a knowledge of binary. Its only disadvantage is that the relays are not marked as being suitable for mains use, which limits its applications.</p>

<p>The Domestic Controller costs &#163;49.95 and is available at Spectrum shops.</p>

<h2>Four ways to plug in power</h2>

<p class="first">THE MASTERPLUG, as marketed by H &amp; K Electrical, may prove a help to computer users who have to fight for the available mains sockets. It is a small, four-way, mains distribution board, with plugs with which you can connect your computer, TV, printer and, perhaps, disc drive to one mains outlet. As supplied it has a 1.5 metre lead and 13amp mains plug fitted.</p>

<p>Each of the small plugs can handle up to six amps and Masterplug can handle 13 amps in all. The plugs are a non-standard size and, as such, may prove difficult, if you often want to plug your computer into different sockets. The plugs are not fused individually but that should cause no difficulty - it is more a matter of personal taste. It is rated to BS5733 for wiring accessories.</p>

<p>Costing &#163;8.99 inc., it is one of the cheapest distribution boards available. H &amp; K is at Bisley, Surrey.</p>

<h2>Comprehensive kit for cleaner computer care</h2>

<p class="first">BIB, better known for its range of hi-fi care kits, has turned its attention to the computer market. A number of new kits are available, top of the range being the Computer Care Kit. It includes Kleen Screen, an anti-static spray and lint-free cloth for cleaning VDU and TV screens; a tape head or floppy disc cleaner with fluid; and Dust Away, a compressed air container for blasting dust from your computer. The tape version costs &#163;8.74 and the disc &#163;9.98.</p>

<p>The Kleen Screen is available separately at &#163;2.99 with two cloths and the disc cleaner at &#163;4.99 or &#163;9.98 for an upgraded version which allows you to clean the head 15 times.</p>

<p>Bib products are available from a number of outlets, including W H Smith and other department stores.</p>

<h2>Interface to perfect print</h2>

<p class="first">THE ZXL PRINT III, from Euroelectronics is one of the most comprehensive printer interfaces available for the Spectrum. With a choice of both Centronics and RS232 in the one interface it will satisfy most users.</p>

<p>The interface has an onboard EPROM which means that you do not have to worry about loading any driving software. Once it has been initialised with the command LPRINT it will output text to any printer. It can then be further configured TO COPY to one of six different printers. There is also the facility to load your own driving software from tape.</p>

<p>With a basic price of &#163;34.95, plus &#163;9.95 for each cable, Centronics or RS232, all inclusive, the interface is one of the cheapest EPROM models on the market. Euroelectronics is at Cheltenham, Glos.</p>
