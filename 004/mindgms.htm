<h1>Simple chess limits moves</h1>

<p class="first">TO DISPEL some confusion about <b>Noughts and Crosses</b>, I have received a letter indicating that I made two statements which contradict each other.</p>

<p>&quot;If you have ever played a computer version of the game, it tends to be very easy to beat&quot;, was the first comment.</p>

<p>That statement refers to a version of the game which contains no skill at all - just the rules to play the game. As you would agree, an uninteresting game with little skill demanded. The second statement is:</p>

<p>&quot;Gives you a chance to win now and then, unlike many Noughts and Crosses which are which are unbeatable ...&quot;</p>

<p>That one refers to what happens if you insert a large amount of skill - it becomes unbeatable and boring. If, however, you have the computer learn by your mistakes, as the article was suggesting, it will become more difficult as you play. That will give players a chance to win, providing that the player always plays to his normal standard.</p>

<p>I was also sent a 1K chess program in a neat package, with a cassette inlay created on the ZX-81 printer, with the instructions on it. The author is D Horne, East Sussex. I have asked for some comments from two other people on the game and I thank Ian Benyon and Leo Amatino for their help.</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on what the game can do, because it had to be fitted into 1K. Those restrictions are no castling, no en-passant, and no pawn promote. The comment on those restrictions was that it spoiled the game. I shall stick out my neck and say what I have always said - that the unexpanded ZX-81 cannot do anything constructive, except be used to control something.</p>

<p>I must also say that after I have seen the game, my mind is not changed. The game is satisfactory for 1K but is nothing like what can be achieved on the ZX-81.</p>

<p>Amatino says he thinks it plays the same game, and both he and Benyon say that it was a very short game. Horne says it is the ultimate for the 1K ZX-81; I suppose that is true.</p>

<p>It is neatly packaged and costs &#163;5. Amatino said that it was not worth the money. I would say that if you have a 1K ZX-81, you could have some enjoyment from this inexpensive game.</p>

<p>A Leicester reader sends details on the Artic Computing ZXchess II. He includes a game which I shall try to include in a future issue. His comments are rather interesting, as they support my point about the end game. He says:</p>

&quot;The end game is less positive&quot;. He says of the save facility of the game: &quot;The most significant advantage of this particular program is the save facility&quot;.

<p>A Cumbrian reader has sent a game played against Sargon 2.5 and ZXchess II. ZXchess won. He says that one bad move by Sargon clinched it. That is interesting, because I have a version of Sargon on my Video Genie computer and I have found it be of reasonable standard.</p>

<p>I shall include some of the many games which have been sent to me when I have played them and can comment on them. One reader has sent a letter saying that he did not know chess games were implemented on such small computers; he must be surprised.</p>

<p>I hope you can send me details of anything to do with chess or mind games in general. Some comments on adventure games would be most helpful, as that is my interest, and I would like to know how other people feel about them.</p>
