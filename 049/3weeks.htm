<h1><i>Three Weeks In Paradise</i></h1>

<p class="first">THE RUSH to bring out 128 software to coincide with the launch of the machine has forced a number of companies to cobble a few extra screens onto the tail-end of existing games. Mikro-Gen is no exception.</p>

<p><b>Three Weeks in Paradise</b> - 128 version - is the proud owner of six new screens and three new objects. Those are fairly easy to find as you start off with the first one - fly paper - and the other two are very obvious.</p>

<p>The only tricky part of the new extended game is to find the screens. A quick exploration will show any of you who know the 48K version that there is only one place the extra screens could be lurking.</p>

<p>They are extremely easy to negotiate, provided you are carrying the right objects, and, due to the lack of warning given by Sinclair, they are distinctive in their simplicity and lack of blazing colour. The screens also differ in their content - instead of jungle, a space theme is prominent and aliens take the place of bats and indians.</p>

<p>Just saunter through the new screens, dodging space invaders, slow-flying bees, two monkeys and an electric charge and three screens of bouncing aliens. The axe lies in the last screen and you must collect that to cut down Wilma.</p>

<p>The music on the 128K version is the same as that of the 48K game but is much enhanced and can be controlled through the TV. I'm not surprised the sound has been left in its original state, the 48K version was excellent and those pathetic beeps even managed to sound tuneful.</p>

<p>As the new screens add an extra, if small, challenge and the price has risen by only one pound, I feel that the 128K version of <b>Three Weeks in Paradise</b> deserves to keep its Classic symbol.</p>
