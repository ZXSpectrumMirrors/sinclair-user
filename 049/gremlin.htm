<p class="first">NERVOUS TIMES, it seems. Gremlin was not invited to the launch of the <b>Spectrum 128</b>, and after hearing what happened Gremlin knows why. But if <b>Sir Clive</b> reckons he can avoid the column so easily he's wrong.</p>

<h2>Clive's big hand</h2>

<p class="first">Imagine, if you will, the holiday snapshot-style slide show <b>Sinclair</b> puts on for its launches. Hacks sit breathless as the screen shows a gigantic eight foot metal-rimmed hole. &quot;Here is the TV slot&quot; intones some Sinclair flunkey. Gruesome stuff.</p>

<p>This time, however, proceedings were enlivened by a soundtrack which opened with stirring martial music.</p>

<p>It dissolved into storms of canned applause, while the assembled hacks dissolved into gales of laughter ...</p>

<h2>Spanish practices</h2>

<p class="first">Ice hockey fan <b>Jason</b> of <b>Friday 13th</b> fame may not be setting you alight in Britain. But the pixellated pervert seems to appeal to Spaniards, according to <b>Domark's</b> chief horror, <b>Dominic Wheatley</b>.</p>

<p>Dominic regales Gremlin with a tale of how his Spanish distributor, one <b>Jose</b>, was over in London explaining why.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw a review in <i>Zzap 64</i>&quot;, said Jose, &quot;which is not a good review. We won't make the same mistake in Spain. We pay the man, we get a good review. We don't get a good review, we break his legs.&quot;</p>

<p>Gremlin would like to inform Jose and any like-minded Spanish distributors that his legs were broken long ago, and now resemble rubbery tentacles with no crunchy bits left at all ...</p>

<h2>Boring exclusive</h2>

<p class="first"><i>Yawn Computing</i> is up to its old tricks again with yet another so-called exclusive on the <b>Spectrum 128</b>. This makes life tough for us in the office as <b>Chris</b> 'Lunch breaks' <b>Bourne</b> works himself into another drunken fury and threatens to ram unopened cans of baked beans down <i>Yawn</i> editor <b>Gary Evans'</b> throat.</p>

<p>Gary, please stop now. Before it's too late ...</p>

<h2>Tropical diseases</h2>

<p class="first">Remember <b>Pong</b>? It was the very first video game, in which a ball wobbled lazily back and forth across the screen while suckers like <b>Edgeley</b> tried to hit it with a bat while offloading the rent money into the machine at the same time.</p>

<p>The peculiar guy who invented Pong was <b>Nolan Bushnell</b>, an obscure Californian who went on to found <b>Atari</b>. Which must prove something.</p>

<p>Anyway, Nolan's back in town after a long rest by the pool with his latest creation, the <b>Petsters</b>. These are electronic cuddly toys which speak to you in strange buzzing noises.</p>

<p>One of the toys is a cuddly mosquito, which seems odd. Does it give you malaria? Well, it's nice to think there are still enough software distributors around to create a reasonable market for the bloodsucking little insect ...</p>

<h2>Gratuitous sex</h2>

<p class="first">Last month Gremlin got steamed up about smutty computer games. So far the response has been a little disappointing - November 1983 is as far back as we've got.</p>

<p>J R Beavis has a nerve putting forward <b>Robin of Sherlock</b> as a candidate, considering it was only released three months ago. OK, so Maid Marian's chastity belt win be unlocked if you know how, but it's obvious Beavis has never had an illicit relationship with Legoland in <b>Bored of the Rings</b>.</p>

<p>And what about the android in the early version of Artic's <b>Ship of Doom</b>? Come on guys, you can do better than this ...</p>

<h2>Potty training</h2>

<p class="first">There are charts, damned charts, and <b>CDS</b> press releases, as <b>Disraeli</b> once said. So it's not surprising CDS wins the <b>Brazen Backslapper of the Month Award</b> for its latest piece of flummery.</p>

<p>The company which brought you <b>Steve Davis Snooker</b> and <b>Colossus 4 Chess</b> claims to be the 'sixth software house' ahead of 'both <b>Firebird</b> and <b>Ultimate'</b>. This remarkable claim is based on a list of the top suppliers to distributor <b>Websters</b> for the previous year.</p>

<p>Websters must have bought an incredible quantity of CDS software over the period, and one wonders what happened to it all. The press release suggests phoning CDS agent <b>Dave Carlos</b>, and promises those who do will learn about life north of Watford and be in at the start of something big. There are however limits to what journalists can reasonably be expected to do, and this is one of them.</p>

<p>STOP PRESS: Websters no longer distributes software.</p>

<h2>Love for sale</h2>

<p class="first">Gremlin got no valentines at all this year, which is hardly surprising. <b>Domark</b>, on the other hand, decided to make a few bob out of romance and offered to shove <b>Valentine Estate Agents</b> signs in your loved one's front garden for 40 quid.</p>

<p>Things started to go wrong when the bloke with the signs failed to turn up on time for an <b>ITN </b> interview. Further disasters followed, with <b>Dominic Wheatley</b> repositioning signs which went to the wrong address in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>&quot;My wife didn't get hers, and neither did <b>Bill Scolding</b>&quot;, wails Dominic. Other customers included <b>Clement</b> 'sex symbol' <b>Chambers</b> of <b>CRL</b>, who ordered two. Gremlin is pretty sure the first was for himself, but who can the second one be for? Certainly not the programmers of <b>iD</b>, which is now being rewritten because the first version was so awful ...</p>

<h2>Scolding at bay</h2>

<p class="first">Quite a few fanzines seem to be coming through the post, and the competition seems to be worrying <b>Bill</b> 'incorruptible' <b>Scolding</b>.</p>

<p>Gremlin, however, rather enjoys these murky corners of the publishing world. So, it appears, does <b>Design Design</b>, which seems to have two concurrent interviews, one in <i>The Bug</i>, and Me other in <i>Interface</i>, in which <b>Simon</b> 'toadface' <b>Bratell</b> explains how all EMAP magazines are biased in favour of <b>Beyond</b>.</p>

<p>For the record, Simon, we were biased in favour of Beyond before we joined EMAP, continued to adore Beyond while it was part of EMAP, and now <b>British Telecom</b> is in charge we'll probably loathe everything it brings out, especially <b>Scooby</b> nominee <b>Superman</b>.</p>

<p>Incorruptible Scolding would also like to point out that he's never received a free dinner or crate of wine from Beyond. Is this a record ...?</p>

<h2>Thorny problem</h2>

<p class="first">Finally, a series of questions to which Gremlin will probably never discover the true answers.</p>

<p>Who sent our very own <b>Norisah</b> 'indispensable' <b>Fenn</b> a single perfect red rose for Valentine's Day?</p>

<p>Why is her typing so much better these days?</p>

<p>What has suddenly made ad manager <b>Louise</b> 'WPC' <b>Fanthorpe</b> so jealous?</p>

<p>Gremlin reckons <b>David White</b> of <b>Saga Systems</b> has a hell of a lot to answer for ...</p>
