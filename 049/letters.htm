<center><h1>Ultimate flatulence</h1></center>

<p class="first">THERE SEEM to be a lot of people who reckon that black coffee and hot beans are the complement to Ultimate's return to excellence - <b>Gunfright</b> - thought I, perusing <i>SU</i> (March issue) but where?</p>

<p>Answer; reach for corresponding Popular Computing Weekly and look at the letters ... Sure enough, a more-than-coincidental similarity between the two letters, the other being featured  in PCW's Arcade Avenue.</p>

<p>Well, well, well, what have we here? Methinks there is a bad spud in the sack.</p>

<p>My only criticism of Nightshade was that the town was too big, and took too long to hunt through. Coupling a smaller town with a more complex scoring system, leads to faster, more varied gameplay - this is more like it!</p>

<p class="first"><b>Gareth Morgan</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>&#8226; Yes, it's annoying, though hardly surprising, that identical letters be sent to more than one magazine. In this instance the said weakly rag appeared long after our March issue had gone to press. At least we published the Pokes, though.</i></p>

<center><h2>Regurgitated garbage</h2></center>

<p class="first">DEAR Bennett of Southend,</p>

<p>Your letter which appeared in <i>Sinclair User</i> 48 was exactly the same as your letter which appeared in <i>Popular Computing Weekly</i>. Did you send a copy to every computer magazine or just those you thought would be daft enough to print it?</p>

<p>While reading your letter on <b>Gunfright</b> I drank plenty of strong black coffee to stop me vomiting the contents of my stomach (baked beans). I can only presume you had either loaded the free tape head cleaner or that you are just an anti-Ultimate kind of person. If this game had been marketed with the Ocean or Beyond logo I am sure you would have raved about it and it would have been given a five star rating from <i>Sinclair User</i>.</p>

<p>In this letter you say also that the original <b>Nightshade</b> was written by Dare. Don't you mean Rare Ltd?</p>

<p>Thank you Ultimate for another excellent game.</p>

<p class="first"><b>A Fan</b></p>

<center><h2>Pathetic protest</h2></center>

<p class="first">THIS IS in protest at <a href="../048/letters.htm#adlard">Roger Adlard's letter</a> in the March issue.</p>

<p>Piracy is wrong, everyone knows that.</p>

<p><b>Gyron, Starion, Elite</b> and <b>Fairlight</b> are reasonably good games, yes.</p>

<p><b>Action Biker</b> is absolutely pathetic.</p>

<p>Your covers are OK.</p>

<p>Ultimate games are EXCELLENT!!!! (not pathetic!)</p>

<p>Does <b>Action Biker</b> stand among <b>Knight Lore, Alien 8, Nightshade</b> or even <b>Gunfright</b>? Huh, ridiculous.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Nick Annies</b></p>

<p class="first">&#8226; <i>Thanks, Nick. I think I know that 'excellent' implies 'not pathetic'. Ultimate games are - or were - pretty good on the whole, but I note that even you refer to &quot;even Gunfright&quot;, admitting that it's not quite up to the classic Ashby standard. Fingers crossed for Cyberun.</i></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was in Dixons and couldn't help noticing a woman with her two sons who were complaining about their Spectrum going wrong. The Spectrum, being their third, had the same fault as the other two. Eventually the youngest of the two sons admitted plugging in the joystick interface while the computer was on.</p>

<p>Not long after, the local TV news had a feature on the same topic. A reporter interviewed a boy who said he couldn't get his games to load. Do you think this is surprising, seeing that his computer and data recorder were less than six inches away from the telly ...?</p>

<p>In wonder how many other faults have been due to misuse.</p>

<p class="first">&#8226; <i>Clive would certainly agree with you, though perhaps the instructions which come with the machine could be more explicit about possible hazards. Poor loading can be caused by TV magnetic fields, but is more likely to be due to cassettes placed on top of the TV set.</i></p>

<p class="first">I WONDER if your expert has given the correct explanation of Mr Desmares' problem of the &quot;microdrive not present&quot; <i>Sinclair User</i>, December 1985 page 47. When I was faced with this problem I found the tape had jammed on the spool and by gently teasing out the tape from the spool a fraction, it ran normally. I also find that after putting in the cartridge, if I push it slightly to the left it runs more smoothly.</p>

<p>Of course, one must not use a metallic object to touch the tape. I found the plastic cap of a Bic ball pen perfect for the job!</p>

<p class="first">I HAVE two points.</p>

<p>Is there going to be an upgrade kit for converting a 48K Spectrum to a 128K? How much will it cost and will it require expert help to fit the new chips?</p>
 
<p>Secondly, Mrs M White of Newhaven - <a href="../048/letters.htm#amazon">letters, March</a> - sounds very much like Mrs E A Jones of Yeovil who has made similar comments in the past in Crash magazine.</p>

<p>Both I feel sorry for, and hope they have good locks on the children's bedroom doors, as the drawing in question is tame compared to what you see walking down the high street.</p>

<p class="first">I AM retired and there aren't many of my circle of friends who are keen computer types. So my main contact with what is going on in the computer world is via magazines and <i>Sinclair User</i> is top of the list.</p>

<p>I'm not great on games but do enjoy programming. So it was a relief to find that other readers echo my experiences. Firstly that the service from Transform is first-rate. Most things arrive by return post and an Epson printer, which I had expected to take about four weeks, came within ten days.</p>

<p>I too have been caught by the claims of <b>Blast</b> and found within a few moments I had half a dozen Basic programs that it won't compile. Letters to them remain unanswered. The security system drives me mad.</p>

<p>The need for compiling Basic is a bit over-stressed and generally isn't really necessary, but if a faster operation is required and machine code isn't favoured then I would suggest that Pascal gives the speed and can be learned almost as easily as Basic. A Pascal compiler is a much better bet for success than <b>Blast</b>.</p>

<p>On the plus side I'd like to add OCP's <b>Finance Manager +80</b> which I find is superb. To this I'd add <b>Masterfile, Omnicalc 2</b> and, of course, <b>Tasword</b>.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Stan Wheeler</b></p>

<p class="first">WITH REFERENCE to the blasting of <b>Blast</b>, - <a href="../048/letters.htm#blast">March, <i>Sinclair User</i></a> - I wonder if I've got the same software.</p>

<p>As an 'oldie' (over 30), I was frustrated by my ability, or lack of it, to program only in Basic, and I wrote several rather pedestrian games.</p>

<p>Since I received <b>Blast</b>, all has changed. It may not be 40 times faster but even in P-code I've been able to put in frills (extra random losers etc) which couldn't be done using Basic.</p>

<p>Thanks for an excellent mag.</p>

<p class="first"><b>R A Buckley</b></p>

<p class="first">OCS SENT ME three different versions of <b>Blast</b>, none of which did anything useful at all, except transfer to microdrive. I gave up on them in the end, deciding it would be simpler to learn machine code programming than try to figure out my heavily annotated version of the manual. Twenty-five quid wasted.</p>

<p class="first">IT WAS with great interest that I read <a href="../048/news.htm#tk90x">your news item on the Brazilian Spectrum</a>, the TK 90 X, mainly because I reside in Brazil and I am the owner of one.</p>

<p>However, your article states that the TK is completely compatible with the Spectrum. This is not the case - at least on the version sold in Latin America. Microdigital, who make the TK, has substituted the ULA chip for half a dozen anonymous chips which leads to this incompatibility. Most programs in the UK will run on the TK, but others like <b>Elite</b> or <b>Tomahawk</b> won't. Before your readers rush out to buy a TK, be warned it's not cheap,costing around &#163;195 at the moment. The I/O ports are in different locations to those of the Spectrum, so normal add-ons won't fit and the general finish and reliability is nowhere near the standard of the Spectrum.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of having a Spectrum lookalike in Brazil is the vast amount of software available, and at very low prices. Most reputable software shops will sell you any of the more popular UK programs for 95 pence, if you deal mail order then you can buy (say) <b>Saboteur, Beach Head 2</b> or <b>Gyroscope</b> for 60 pence. All of these programs are pirated copies, which have been smuggled into the country.</p>
