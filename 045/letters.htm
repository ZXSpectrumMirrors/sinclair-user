<center><h1>Blast compiler a damp squib</h1></center>

<p class="first">IT IS NOT very often that I read something which makes me angry, but Marcus Jeffrey has done just that with his review of Blast - October, SU.</p>

<p>The software I received had an errata sheet stating that some commands were not working, and that an updated version would be sent later. After finding that it would not compile a simple ten line program, I requested a refund, but was persuaded to try an updated version.</p>

<p>On receipt I tried once again. This time the program did compile but the runtime was the same speed as Basic. Both versions to P-code and M-code resulted in longer code but no increase in speed which was visible on the screen.</p>

<p>I then tried to compile two Basic programs. The first locked up and the second was even worse. I sent Oxford Computer Systems the program so that they could have a go. It was suggested that I try another version, but at this point I asked for my money back, which I duly received.</p>

<p>I am a serious programmer and Blast, or should I call it Phut, was about as much use to me as a hole in the head. What does Marcus Jeffery do - sell cars?</p>

<p class="first"><b>Patrick Norris</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>I tested the product on a wide range of programs, of which only one failed. Unfortunately, you didn't mention which version of Blast you were using. As I undentand it, versions of Blast had been sent out prior to the review, and errors were being corrected. Not only would OCS try to compile any program which failed, but all customers would receive version updates as they became available.</i></p>

<p><i>I am told that due to a tape duplication error, a number of copies have been released which incorrectly claim to be version 3.0. Version 3.n will now have been released - still containing one known bug when compiling into machine code - and possibly even version 4.0 which will additionally contain an integer compiler.</i></p>

<p><i>Blast does have its drawbacks, and I would not recommend anybody compiling large programs on a tape system. Nevertheless, at the time of the review, Blast was the only compiler claiming to be able to handle all Spectrum Basic.</i></p>

<p><i>By the way, is anybody interested in a second-hand Metro? One careful owner ... Marcus Jeffrey.</i></p>

<p class="first">I WOULD like to point out to R A Smith - <a href="../042/letters.htm#smith">September letters</a> - that the title of your magazine is Sinclair User.</p>

<p>Sir Clive Sinclair doesn't just make Spectrums and QLs but C5s and pocket televisions.</p>

<p>Sinclair User should cover the C5 and any future Sinclair developments to make it worthy of its name.</p>

<p>I agree with Mr Smith that politics should be omitted from SU but Sinclair inventions should feature without question. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>I can't imagine how it is possible to give Danger Mouse in Double Trouble as high a rating as your magazine did. The graphics ... OK, but the game is absolutely boring. And then Jet Set Willy 2 got only three stars.</p>
