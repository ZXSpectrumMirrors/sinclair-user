<p class="first">THERE ARE no plans to launch the 128K Spectrum in Britain this year but Sinclair Research is pleased with the publicity the machine has had from the British press.</p>

<p>Eileen Counihan, spokeswoman for the company, says: &quot;We are quite pleased with the British press. They have at least got the point across that there won't be a 128K in Britain this year. We are not giving any more details and don't want to announce anything until plans are more definite&quot;.</p>

<p>British software houses are already being enticed by Sinclair to write for the Spanish market but they have been sworn to secrecy. David Ward of Ocean would say nothing of his plans for the

128 but agreed that events are overtaking Sinclair. &quot;I'm not allowed to say anything about our relationship with Sinclair. It is clear that they wanted to sell off their Spectrum Plus backlog before launching the 128 in Britain. The Spectrum Plus is selling faster than anyone expected. Dixons must be well through the first part of their &#163;10 million order by now. The machines are flying out of the doors&quot;.</p>

<p>Dr Tim Langdell, managing director of The Edge, the company which has recently brought out <b>Fairlight</b>, is being similarly tight-lipped. &quot;We have signed a non-disclosure contract with Sinclair. It would seem logical, however, that British software houses are being asked to provide products for the Spanish machine. It's no secret that there are only a couple of software houses in Spain. Britain has been the major source of software in Europe for some time.&quot;</p>

<img src="news1.jpg" width=250 height=159 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="right" alt="Spectrum 128 with keypad">

<p>We did manage to catch one software house before they were muzzled by Sinclair. Paul Denial, marketing director of Mikro-Gen, says that his company has been approached and that consultative meetings are taking place. &quot;We have had the memory map diagrams and have been promised a development machine, but that hasn't materialised yet. We have been looking into the possibility of adapting our Mikro-Plus games system to the machine. We are looking at the memory maps and there doesn't seem to be a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Denial hopes that the 128K will soon be on sale in countries such as France. &quot;The Spectrum market is still small in France, mainly because it has a different TV system to that of Britain. If you want to run a Spectrum over there you have to buy an interface which costs &#163;80.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, AB Electronics, manufacturer of the Spectrum Plus, has denied reports that it has tooled up for production of the 128.</p>

<p>The company stresses that it has received no orders from Sinclair Research although there are indications that the situation may change in the near future.</p>

<p class="first">THE C5 HAS survived despite the collapse of TPD, the company which controlled Sir Clive Sinclair's electric car industry.</p>

<p>The business has been plagued by misfortune. In August the C5 assembly line at the Hoover plant in Merthyr Tydfil was closed because, the company claimed, Sir Clive owed &#163;1.5 million for work already completed. That problem was resolved but, because of the high stocks of C5 still available, there are no plans to restart production.</p>

<p>Eileen Counihan, a spokeswoman for Sinclair Research, says: &quot;The name of the electric car company was recently changed from Sinclair Vehicles Ltd to TPD. Although that has been wound up, Sinclair Vehicles Ltd will deal with orders.&quot;</p>

<p>TPD was put into the hands of receivers David Sapte and Anthony Locke of Begbies, with debts of &#163;700,000 to 110 suppliers. Counihan says: &quot;Sir Clive's investment in the company was &#163;7 million. It was put into receivership to ensure the future of electric transport. Sinclair Vehicles Sales Ltd will continue to take orders from Britain and abroad.&quot;</p>

<p>The C5 has gained more favour abroad than in Britain, according to Sinclair, because of antipathy towards it from the press. Research and development is still continuing although the launches of the C10 and C15 have been delayed.</p>

<p>The C10 is planned as an enclosed two-seater vehicle with a range of 40 miles; the C15 has a similar range but is a four-seater. Sinclair has revealed that development is fairly advanced for both models and that the C15 has already been tested in a wind tunnel.</p>

<p class="first">THE FIRST World Computer Surfing Championships were held at Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, Eire at the beginning of October.</p>

<p>The event was organised by the Irish software house, New Concepts, to tie in with the launch of its revolutionary game, <b>Surfchamp</b>, which uses a miniature surfboard placed over the Spectrum keys to simulate the action of surfing. The game is previewed in Software Scene this month.</p>

<center><img src="news3.jpg" width=540 height=380 border=0 alt="The English team, winners of the Computer Surfing Championships, and Jed Stone, third from left, winner of the individual event"></center>

<p>The competition coincided with the European Surfing Championships at Rossnowlagh, in which 160 surfers participated. Fortunately for New Concepts, County Donegal experienced exceptionally calm seas during the championships, and observers were treated to the unusual sight of dozens of bronzed blond beach boys fighting for a go on the computer as an alternative to the real thing.</p>

<p>The computer contest was won by Jed Stone, the English surfing champion, with a score of 2121. The English team also won the team event.</p>

<p>Norman McMillan, managing director of New Concepts, describes <b>Surfchamp</b> as &quot;the first accurate simulation of sport&quot; and has plans for skiing and sailing simulations which further develop the concept of original keyboard overlays.</p>

<p><b>Surfchamp</b> received a unanimous thumbs-up from the surfers and whole-hearted approval from officials, including Rod Brooks, president of the Australian Surfing Association, and Reg Prytherch, president of the International Surfing Association. All that remains is for New Concepts to convince the fickle public that Surfchamp is an exciting absorbing departure in software.</p>

<p class="first">A DISCOUNT of &#163;10 on the Kempston Centronics E printer interface is available to purchasers of the LTR-1 letter quality printer from Saga Systems.</p>

<p>The offer is available only through Saga Systems. Christopher Smith, sales manager of the company, says: &quot;With the LTR-1 printer costing &#163;119.95, Spectrum owners can obtain letter quality print at prices previously undreamed of.&quot;</p>

<p>Saga has also cut the price of its Emperor keyboard by &#163;10 to &#163;39.95. The move comes with the launch of the Saga 3 Elite Keyboard. David White, managing director of Saga Systems, comments: &quot;With our new Elite keyboard and the Saga 2 Profile we can provide keyboards for the Spectrum covering a wide price range and satisfying most demands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's conjecture, and bears no relation to any fact&quot;, says Sinclair Research spokeswoman Eileen Counihan. &quot;We're a bit worried about the way the story has been presented, with made-up drawings - it's completely fabricated.&quot;</p>

<p>Sinclair Research makes no secret of the fact that it has been holding discussions with Digital Research about transferring GEM to the QL, or a QL-based machine, but dismisses the present conjectures. The company is also angry at suggestions that the alleged information was leaked.</p>

<p><i>Your Computer</i>'s assistant editor Meirion Jones stands by the story. It is based on information from inside Sinclair,&quot; he says. &quot;A number of people are very annoyed with what's been happening to them there, and are leaking information. I don't see how Sinclair Research can deny the core points made in the story.&quot;</p>

Bill Delaney, managing director of Beyond says: &quot;We have no qualms about going to BT and are happy that they've taken us on. There won't be any significant changes in Beyond. We will continue with our planned range of products.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Beyond has just launched its Christmas range, one of its products, the third in the <b>Lords of Midnight</b> trilogy, is missing. <b>Eye of the Moon</b> is unlikely to be launched until late spring, next year. Clive Bailey, marketing manager of Beyond, says: &quot;The author, Mike Singleton, is way behind with another game, <b>Quake Minus One</b>.&quot;</p>

<p class="first">SINCLAIR RESEARCH is selling twice as many computers as Acorn and Commodore put together, according to a recent survey by Audits of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Its market share for the four weeks ending September 7 was 56.8 per cent, which is a 20 per cent rise on the last figures published. The bulk of the sales is made up by the Spectrum Plus. The QL lags behind with less than six per cent of sales, followed by other products, such as Sinclair Research peripherals and software, at just half a per cent.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Although the Spectrum Plus is top of the league, the QL has made the most dramatic leap in sales. The machine's market share has jumped by just under five per cent after only one week at the new &#163;199 price.</p>

<p>Alison Maguire, marketing manager for Sinclair, says: &quot;These figures, like the latest research from MINTEL, show that far from turning its back on home computers the public is buying almost as many as it was last year.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course the peak buying season is not yet fully under way but AGB's data supports what we have already said, that Sinclair products are what the public want to buy.</p>

<p>&quot;The QL market share is also tremendous and backs our decision to reposition the QL at the new price.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite the euphoria from Sinclair, some of the computer manufacturers mentioned in the survey, such as Amstrad, have dismissed the figures as non-representative. It is easy to see why Amstrad, which got a seven per cent slice of the cake, is upset. The poll covered 57,000 units and was taken from such high street stores as Dixons, Laskys, Rumbelows and John Lewis. It did not include Boots and WH Smith.</p>

<p>David Frodsham, marketing manager for Psion says: &quot;<b>Q Draw</b> started life as one of the many powerful software tools written for Psion's own use, and made possible the complex screens for <b>QL Chess</b> and <b>Match Point</b>. It was quickly recognised as an invaluable program for screen drawing and design work, which is why we have released it.&quot;</p>
