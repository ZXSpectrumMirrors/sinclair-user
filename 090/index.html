<h2>Issue 90<br>September 1989</h2>

<p class="first"><b>Meet the Summer TV Special &quot;Team&quot;</b></p></center>

<p class="first"><center><b>Jim &quot;Live from the Palladium&quot; Douglas</b><br>
<img src="index1.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">A strange anomaly of a person, Jim is both achingly unfunny, and yet strangely compelling. What will his Editing hi-jinks lead to this month? Maybe an excellent joke about a red indian ordering a drink or perhaps a swinging dance routine with the internationally revered Jim Douglas Connection. Either way, you'd be mad to miss him. So tune in, drop out, nod off.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Alison &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot; Skeat</b><br>
<img src="index2.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">A dolly dealer if ever we saw one! Now, if Alison plays her cards right this month she could go through to the exciting final where she'll be given the chance to win amazing prizes like ... these!<br>
A Trip to the Typesetters/An Afternoon Ordering Couriers/A Deadline Advancement or tonight's star prize ... Extra Mono Pages in the Inner Section!<br>
Be sure to tune in and see all these prizes and more flash before Alison's eyes in our special section, Nightmare of the Month!</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Tim &quot;3-2-1&quot; Noonan</b><br>
<img src="index3.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">A confusing hour's viewing at the best of times, Showmaster Tim has the entire office bemused and astounded with his complex clues and double-twists. &quot;I'll be in at about 10 o'clock&quot; for example, obviously indicates to the uneducated viewer that Tim will be in at around 10 in the morning. Wrong! Dusty Bin for you! It actually means &quot;I'm going back to bed and I'll see what the weather's like when I get up.&quot; See if you can tell what Tim's talking about.</font></p>

<p class="first"><b>Dynamite Dux</b> comes from the rather clever people at Activision, and since one of their latest releases was the none-too-unpopular R-Type we predicted that it was going to be probably the best game released this month. Were we right? Yes, actually, we were. And we've lavished an extraordinary three blummin' pages on the thing in order to let you in on the extra superness of it all.</p>

<p class="first">Good evening. And in a packed programme tonight, previews will be asking such questions on the nation's lips: &quot;What on earth has <b>Super Wonderboy</b> got on his head?&quot;, &quot;What the dickens are US Gold going to do with a game title called <b>Skweek</b>?&quot;, &quot;How is <b>Cabal</b> coming along?&quot; All these and more will be answered, on this show, tonight!</p>

How many colour pages? FIVE. Yus. Not four or seven or three or none, but FIVE COLOUR SEXIES, sorry PAGES choc full of well, DIRTY TRICKS. They're DIRTY. They're TRICKS. And it's a DEPARTMENT! Lawks!</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Poster</b></font><br>
Indiana Jones! Da da da daaah, duh duh duuuuhh. He's back. And this time, he bought some wrinkly old Scottish geezer with him! Check out Indy and his dad Gareth and then put them on your wall, why dontcha?</p>

<b>Strider</b>. One of USG's biggies and this month we can give you a complete machine code printout of all the protection routines and the graphics generator used by the programmers. Well, alright, we can't. What we can give you, though, is a more thorough investigation of how the game was put together thanks to the rather helpful programmy people. Far more interesting than a page full of numbers.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>SAM Coupe Special</b></font><br>
The SAM Coupe could well take the Spectrum world by storm when it come out next year. What, exactly, does it have to offer? Why don't you have a look?</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Outlands</b></font><br>
Alright alright alright! We're sick and tired of everyone asking us &quot;'Ere. This satellite business. It's all to do with Amstrad isn't it? Well, I was wondering, since you're very good mates with Alan Sugar, could you tell me exactly what frequency modulator I need to install in order to pick up the signals and what's the difference between SKY and BSB and who is Rupert Murdoch and how many giggerhertz ...&quot; So these people can ruddy well go away. Instead, we've got a far more interesting selection of facts and figures in our SATELLITE TV SPECIAL. Oh, and we're giving away a dish too.</p>
