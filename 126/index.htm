I mean let's face it, whether you're destroying mad meanies from space or wimping out of a confrontation with Indy's Nazi foes or Hulk Hogan you're gonna want to keep those energy reserves up by stuffing your face. As usual the SU Crew are on hand with excellent culinary advice.</b></p>

<p class="first"><b>Yvette Nichols<br>
Art Editor</b><br>
When she's not banging out a high score on How To Get A Mag Out On Time And Still Remain Sane Yvette loves to tuck into a nice jar of peanut butter. Alternatively she can be found munching on tinned minced beef, smash, deep pan pizzas, rice crispies or a bagel topped off with smoked salmon flavored cream cheese. Of course given the option Yvette could subsist solely on vegemite (an antipodean yeast concoction) but she's not allowed to bring the stuff into the office ... Last time she did it got into the Speccy and it took three months for an army of specially imported New Zealand bred ants to eat it off the Z80.<br>
Fave Games: Turbo Tortoise, 3D Snooker</p>

<p class="first"><b>Alan Dykes<br>
Editor</b><br>
In between playing Super Advanced Better Than All The Rest Top Notch Highly Realistic Knitting Simulator, and doing his bit for Anglo Irish relations, Big AI likes nothing better than to tuck into a nice chocolate fudge cake. Also top in the big ones culinary culminations are chocolate eclairs, chocolate sponge cake, hot chocolate, chocolate ice cream and to round it all off a nice bag of dry roasted, chocolate covered peanuts. What a guy.<br>
Fave Games: Indy 4, 3D Pool</p>

<p class="first"><b>Paul Anglin<br>
Wacky Dude</b><br>
In between watching Liverpool videos, listening to U2 and playing SMASH TV the youngster of the bunch (provided his resident cook/mother isn't busy) likes nothing better than to chew on a box of chocolate chip cookies and slurp an ice cream soda. Also amongst the short ones fave dishes are deep pan pizzas with ham, mushrooms, pepperoni, peppers, onions with spicy beef, finished with a round of garlic bread. (That's why he's a fat so-and-so - Al)<br>
Fave Games: 3D Snooker, Turbo the Tortoise</p>

<p class="first"><b>Tina Zanelli<br>
Ad Manager</b><br>
Tina's favourite game is trying to create extra pages in the mag so that she can fit in all the ads she's wangled. But when she finds a spare minute she likes nothing better than to dive into a huge tub of Haagen Daaz chocolate ice cream. But this can be a trifle fattening so she does have a few low calorie dishes on her menu; popcorn, ricotta cheese tortellini with double cream, two thousand cloves of garlic and a litre or ten of fine (non-alcoholic) Italian vino, all shared in the company of a certain Christian Slater.<br>
Fave Games: Little Puff (Quattro Collection), Megasports</p>

<p class="first"><b>Matthew Walker<br>
Production Editor</b><br>
Well folks it's a sad bye to Matthew this month. It seems as though it was only yesterday that he arrived along to SU Towers eating raw garlic with tomato ketchup dressing. Now he's off to pastures green to eat some grass which, I'm told, he's very fond of. Before he goes he wants to say something to all of you; &quot;I'm off!&quot; Eloquent as always, Matthew will be sorely missed.<br>
