<h2>Last month's password was : DECODE</h2></center>

<p class="first">This month's Great 8 follows the back to school trail with a super educational game for all the family, <b>Henrietta's Book Of Spells</b>. It has five fun tests and multiple difficulty levels so that kids of all ages can learn from it and have a good time while doing so. You've all discovered by now how good <b>Icon Graphix</b> is and to make it even better we've included <b>Ten Fonts</b> to use with the program. They're quite wacky and include an Egyptian Hieroglyphics font. The third part of Starship Quest is ready for lift off, provided you have completed Part 2. Fear not though, we'll have hints next month. <b>Blok Load</b> is a program backing up package while <b>Blava Demo</b> is a music and graphics demo from Bratislava in Slovakia. Finally there's a <b>Popeye 3</b> screenshot demo and a fully loadable, exclusive, SU level for the game, and of course <b>Pokemania</b> and the new kid on the block <b>Hacks Amazing</b>.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Yvette Nichols, everyone's fave designer had a brainwave a few weeks ago after getting stuck into SU's mega Icon Graphix: Forget about designing the world's best Spectrum mag, how about making some extra money by impersonating some of history's great artists! Unfortunately she didn't have the same people to paint so the good old SU Crew filled in for a few of the more famous mugs on the walls of history.</b></p>

<p class="first"><b>THE LAUGHING BIG AL</b><br>
Notice the fine brushes on this work, done by Nichols in the early hours of Sunday morning after a night out on the town and more than a few Steinlagers. The insensitive way the light bounces off Big Al's teeth is testimony to the broken tube in Yvette's overhead lamp while the jacket took 'absolutely hours' to paint. Notice the way she combines old world elegance with new world thuggery in a celebration of the transience of true art.</p>

<p class="first"><b>THE CAVALIER SUMPTER</b><br>
The ability of Nichols to embrace a whole subject, yet capture a single moment in time is amply illustrated by this fine work, completed late Tuesday afternoon over a celery and vegemite sandwich. Not a person to stay in one position for too long, her subject, Garth, had to be tied up and tickled by Tina until Yvette had completed all of her preliminary sketches. The sparsely daubed paint reflects the fact that the art supply shop was shut at the time.</p>

<p class="first"><b>ZANELLI THE EIGHTH</b><br>
Nichols turned to the sixteenth century for inspiration on this fine piece, depicting Tina in a Henry the Eighth outfit, trying to look as silly as she can while recording one of the most serious monarchs in English history. The simpler, flatter tones in this work belie the fact that Yvette was very tired while painting it as it was very late and Al had been telling her terrible jokes all day.</p>

<p class="first"><b>DR. STEVE 'GACHET' KEEN</b><br>
A much more up to date work, Dr. Steve 'Gachet' Keen represents a post impressionist phase in Yvette's week, being painted on the morning after she does her patented Rolf Harris impressions in the local Kiwi club. The strokes are so strong because Yvette was buttering her toast at the time and decided to use her knife to apply the paint in time honoured fashion. This is amply illustrated by close examination of Steve's mouth which is completely jammed with toast.</p>

<p class="first"><b>MONA NICHOLS</b><br>
This self portrait, 'Mona Nichols' is not really very good. It doesn't have either the smile or the delicate, wisping paintwork on the face of the original. Not surprising as it was done from a Polaroid (Big Al's banned mirrors from the office so that Steve can't brush his hair all day). All of these works will be going up for private auction on the 13th of September 1992. Emap is expected to purchase them for the Tower's lobby.</p>
