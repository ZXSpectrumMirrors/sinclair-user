<p class="first"><b>Alan Dykes</b><br>
The Big Guy has been out and about in the countryside this month - &quot;There's nothing better than breath of fresh country air&quot;, he was quoted as saying from his cow pat in Somerset. Besieged by election campaigners earlier on in the month he decided to make a quick escape and leave editing the magazine to a large robot hand he's spent the last six months developing. It seems to work really well and most of the girlies in the office are pleased too because it doesn't try to chat them up as much as Alan or Garth did.</p></td>

<p class="first"><b>Yvette Nicholls</b><br>
Yvette, now known as the jet setting designer because of the fact that She has been all around the world while designing this month's SU, has been having a really good time. First she went to Africa, and sampled some of the local dance routines and food, then she went to France and sampled some culture and wine and finally she made her way back to New Zealand where she sampled some sheep and some rain. She's had a brilliant time and she wishes you all could have come with her but unfortunately her surf board wouldn't have been big enough for everyone. Pity.</p></td>

<p class="first"><b>Tina Zanelli</b><br>
By the time you read this Tina will either still be. an SU Crew member, a Labour MP for north London, or else an MP in the Italian parliament, such are her wide ranging talents. &quot;If I get made an MP I will immediately reduce VAT on Spectrum games to zero and put up VAT on all other games to 600 per cent!&quot; This is the main part of her manifesto but she also intends to enforce a law requiring all cars to have at least one furry animal on their dashboard. Tina has been canvassing extensively, both in London and in Rome, and she hopes that the life of a minister will be easier than the life of an SU Crew member, with everything that entails!</p></td>

<p class="first"><b>Cyril Herelle</b><br>
Limelight seeking Cyril is a new member of the SU crew, we got him from a second hand shop in west London and man does he have a second hand. In fact he has a first hand too and both of them are so big that ostriches have been seen nesting in them. Although we didn't actually see the ostriches there were a few suspicious feathers stuck around Cyril's lips. Cyril wants everyone to know (especially all the girlies) that although he looks like Mike Tyson, he fights like Mike Tyson and eats dinner like Mike Tyson he is in fact a big old softie who loves his dog and his Spectrum dearly.</p></td>
