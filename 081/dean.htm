<p class="first">Above the Bus Station of Doom were seven mystic signs, each the number of a magic om-ni-bus. Choose the bus service and move to the like numbered paragraph.</p>

<p class="first"><a href="#p1">1</a>) To ye Electronic Shoppes, where ye may repair thy damaged Spectrume. <a href="#p2">2</a>) To ye Coin-op Arcades. <a href="#p3">3</a>) To ye Software Shoppes. <a href="#p4">4</a>) To ye newsagents. <a href="#p5">5</a>) To ye Record Shoppes. <a href="#p6">6</a>) To ye Foodstores. <a href="#p7">7</a>) To ye Clothing Shoppes.</p>

<p class="first">Your Spectrum is ill, and your first great task is to have it repaired. Three repair shoppes meet your heroic gaze. One is a Dixonnes Electrical Shoppe, a plastic castle, festooned with bright banners and posters. A drooling, deformed idiot mans the drawbridge. He wears a badge saying &quot;MANAGER&quot;. If you decide to go in, go to <a href="#p23">23</a>.</p>

<p class="first">To the left is a small, shabby shop marked &quot;MR SHABBYS SHOPPE&quot;. A sign reads &quot;We fix computers proper, dead cheap&quot;. In the doorway stands Mr Shabby, a shortsighted dwarf. If you choose to go in, turn to <a href="#p24">24</a>.</p>

<p class="first">To the right is Castle Amstrad. Grinning gargoyles line the parapets. Corpses hang from the battlements. The armoured figure of Baron Sugar grins at you from a turret. If you really, really think it's a good idea to go in, go to <a href="#p25">25</a>.</p>

<p class="first">Magic bus 2 takes you to the coin-op arcades. There you face a fearsome choice. Will you put your 10p into Afterburner? (Turn to <a href="#p8">8</a>). Will you put 10p into the strange, unmarked black cabinet standing mysteriously at the back of the arcade ... ooo-eee-oooh! (Turn to <a href="#p9">9</a>). Or will it be the latest coin-op sensation, Alien Slug Death? (Turn to <a href="#p10">10</a>).</p>

<br clear=all>

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p3">3</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first">Bus 3 takes you to the Bigge Software Shoppe. The range of products available is staggering. There are three of them. (It must he H W Smitheys.) Which will you buy - <i>Big Film Licence and the Temple of Profit</i> from Gilsoft at &#163;10.95 (go to <a href="#p11">11</a>), <i>Mr Wibble</i> from Happisoft Games at &#163;1.99 (go to <a href="#p12">12</a>) or <i>190 Complete Dodos Compilation</i> from Gilsoft at &#163;113.98 (go to <a href="#p13">13</a>)</p>

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p4">4</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first">At the newsagents. Now is that crucial time in your quest when you choose which magazine to buy. Which is it to be? <i>Cosmopolitan</i>? (go to <a href="#p14">14</a>.) <i>Sinclair User</i> (go to <a href="#p15">15</a>). Or some lesser computer magazine, printed on earth-closet paper and written by fairies? (Go to <a href="#p16">16</a>, though I warn you, you won't like it).</p>

<br clear=all>

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p5">5</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first">At the Virgin Megabuck, hundreds of glossily-packaged vie for your attention. Which will you buy? Something by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, because &quot;I know the artists are disposable but don't they have admirable production values?&quot; (turn to <a href="#p17">17</a>). A James Brown classic (turn to <a href="#p18">18</a>). Or <i>We're All Acid Crazy Bonkers</i> by Doped-up Larry and the Smiley House People? (turn to <a href="#p19">19</a>).</p>

<p class="first">At ye Foodstores, a wonderment of fried, baked, braised, grilled, microwaved and underdone nourishment hangs floppily from the food-vendors' stalls. At the left stands Elfin Jim the Butcher. &quot;I got meat pies, meat sandwiches, meat rolls, meat on a stick, meat paste, meat cutlets and meat&quot; he bawls. If you feel like a bit of meat, turn to <a href="#p20">20</a>. In the centre is The Silver Pixie Health food shop, festooned with buttercup cakes, daffodil burgers and watercress salad. If you like rabbit food, turn to <a href="#p21">21</a>. To the right is MacDonagall's, where a hideous dwarf chains up little children and rams plastic burgers down their throats while singing a happy song about defoliating South America. To visit MacDonagall's, turn to <a href="#p22">22</a>.</p>

<br clear=all>

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p7">7</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first">At the clothes shoppes. Now it is time to equip yourself for further adventuring. Do you pick: A Millet's parka, flared jeans, Marks &amp; Spencer bri-nylon shirt and Mr Byrite codpiece (turn to <a href="#p26">26</a>). A Smiley T-shirt, baseball cap, bandanna, baseball boots, mirror shades and matching flamethrower (turn to <a href="#p27">27</a>). Or a Burton's suit (of armour) with flared gusset, daringly fluked greaves and seriously rad wide lapels (turn to <a href="#p28">28</a>).</p>

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p8">8</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first">At the arcade, you put your 10p into Afterburner, and stand stupefied when you realise that it costs &#163;11.95 per game. That was a waste of money, wasn't it? As you trudge home you are knocked over and killed by an elephant.</p>

<p class="first">You put your money into the strange black box, and are rewarded by a torrent of glistening coins. Again and again you insert money, and each time you are rewarded with a fountain of wealth. Well pleased, <a href="#p0">you return to the bus station</a> for your next quest, pausing only to brush aside the cobwebs which hide the mystic runes on the box; &quot;CHANGE MACHINE...&quot;</p>

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p11">11</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first"><i>Big Film Licence and the Temple of Profit</i> contains a sticker, a badge, a membership card for the Gloatsoft Glee Club, a money off voucher, a poster, a false rubber nose, a sachet of dehydrated turnip and a small glob of green putty. There's no space inside for the game. You have failed in your quest, and must disembowel yourself with a garden implement.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Mr Wibble</i> is such a marvellous game that you faint with ecstasy, and dream that Sabrina, Bananarama and Kim Wilde are all massaging custard into your quivering body. <a href="#p0">You set off back to the Bus Station</a> with renewed vigour.

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p13">13</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first"><i>190 Complete Dodos</i> turns out to be just that, and you bitterly regret being led astray by the picture on the cover showing Princess Stella struggling into her see-through plastic space bikini. Your money gone, you return home defeated.</p>

<p class="first">As you pick up <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, the newsagent pulls out a mighty broadsword and cuts off your head. &quot;Eeh-up, we've nay taam for jessie-boys in dis parish, b'wanah&quot; he explains in a strange Manchester-Swahili accent, which you are too dead to be confused by.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Sinclair User!</i> What a fine, noble choice! The newsagent bows before you, refuses to accept your money and offers you his most beautiful daughter, Fatima, as a gift. Politely, you decline, and <a href="#p0">saunter back to the station</a> for your next quest.</p>

<br clear=all>

<center><p class="first"><b><font size="+2"><a name="p16">16</a></font></b></p></center>

<p class="first">As you reach for the lesser computer magazine, the earth trembles, a crevasse opens and you are dragged down to Hell by a horde of screaming demons tearing at your flesh and ripping up your priceless collection of marmalade jar labels. Worse is to follow, but you deserve everything you get.</p>
