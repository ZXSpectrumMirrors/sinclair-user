old clasle tut Technitlan Ted on the Racial: budget label. That was originally written in the good ald days at clrca 1984 Dunng the writing of tne game, time was no peblem as nO-One even knew at its existence apart from the two authors This meant that it was possible ta give it the ﬁnal polish that a lot of games don’t have avan toduya A case in point was the loading routine. wnen tninklng up new ideas lar a prolect, l' is virtually lmpossible to stand palsed Ilka the statue at ’The mnw (or any length at tune and hope lo come up with anything. 
Far these who have never seen the leader, I will describe I. The screen slams and prints 0 couplu at banners — one at the tap and one at the bottom. In tne bottom banner there is a sauntdawn clock [in seconds) which decrements during the load. In the middle blank section of the screen there are 10 ’Tethnictan Yeds' running left and right at venous speeds, alsa while the game .5 loading. Remember this was done ﬁve years ago when the besl loaders of the era consisted of nothing more than a pvetty picture to look at far 4 mll’llﬂes (mare interesting to bail on egg ehl) Right, how is it done?

TOO SIMPLE! 
Obviously it is not simple to run another routine in 100 microsecond chunks and we also have to worry about contended! uncentended RAM. Yhs Spectrum like most other home computers has e problem when the screen .5 stored in the same memory me as the RAM used tar rogmms and data etc. This because the video :trcuitry has to access the memory without (all every 50th at a second. lfthe Z80 wants to read orwrite to the screen at the same instant as the video circutlry, the ZBO has to wait fat 0 while until the video has done its stuff. It the 230 had pnertty over the video cirtum'y, our picture would suffer from incredible interference so poor old 280 setters instead the net result is that the processor true speed is reduced by some 25% m the video qr contended memory, As the tape routines are so prezise 7 especially during the save, they need to be replaced u. ROM or in unconlended RAM, 
The placement at the routtne is easy 7 we will put our louder lrl uncontended

RAM in a canven‘ﬁm Ieeehon. The other ettheutty is that dunng our 100 mtcmsecond of actmty we Mn be eeeessmg the screen 7 for our countdown clock tor example This makes to dtfiicuh to atmrate‘y work out the exad timmg so we have to resort to some ﬁeld testmg by Varying the hmlng unli| we gel the most reliable msutts
