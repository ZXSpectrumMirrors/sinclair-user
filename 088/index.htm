<p class="first"><center><b>Jim &quot;Invisible Man&quot; Douglas</b><br>
<img src="index1.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Wrapped (warped?) from head to foot in bandages to disguise his horrible secret, Jim is forced to wander the world trapped in a cr&ecirc;pe tomb. While he likes to put about the rumour that he concocted a potion so strong that it turned him invisible, the actual truth is that the rest of the SU Team were so fed up with him being &quot;away on business&quot; they endowed him with the name and handed out a right good punching into the bargain, hence the bandages.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Alison &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; Skeat</b><br>
<img src="index2.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Faster than a speeding thing, able to correct pages in a single bound, Skeat wreaks terrible havoc upon poor copy with her special Red Pen in her quest to rid Sinclair User of any spelling mistakes. She can deflect bad grammar with her super steel ear-rings and head-butts away repetition every single time. and head-butts away repetition every single time.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Tim &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; Noonan</b><br>
<img src="index3.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Is it a plane? Is it a bus? Is it a Bond Bug? No, you bloody idiot, it's Timothy Noonan, Art Editor extraordinaire, cutting a swathe through the barren wasteland of computer magazine layout, producing colour pages to STUN, SHOCK and DELIGHT every single month. Unfortunately, Tim has only one leg. Well, it's more unfortunate for Tim than anyone else, since he can never stay upright once he stops moving.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Tony &quot;Ice Man&quot; Dillon</b><br>
<img src="index4.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Tony knows no fear. He doesn't know many people, but he certainly knows even less fear. His super-cool demeanour and ability to fit nearly all his bottom into a medium-sized refrigerator have made him legendary through the games industry. If a job wants doing, tell Tone to dry his trousers and get going.</font></p>

<p class="first"><b>Silkworm</b>. We tipped it as a classic last month in Blueprint and our Previews, and we weren't wrong. It's bloody marvellous, and if our saucy illo by the notorious Jerry Paris hasn't got your whistle whetted, this review will.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Dirty Tricks Dept</b></font><br>
Welcome to the amazingly brilliant all new look, jazzed up Tips section. This month we've got an amazing FIVE COLOUR PAGES including super maps of <b>Forgotten Worlds</b> from US Gold (Sinclair User cover game) and <b>Run The Gauntlet</b> from Ocean. If you're stuck in <b>R-Type</b> you may well find out where you're going wrong, and there are stacks of Pokes, including some for <b>Operation Wolf</b>. The egotistical among you can even get your names in lights in the Bronze Stars section. Check it out.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Wayne's Popularity Game</b></font><br>
Fun and games for all the family! Help new Sinclair User staff member Wayne Smedley in his search for popularity. All you need is a six sided dice (as opposed to one of those ludicrous dodecahedralatrop used by D&amp;D people) and a great deal of patience. Try to work your way to the top of the popularity heap by being extremely crawly and girly around the office. Watch out for terrible faux pas like asking Tim how Palace did at the weekend.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Poster</b></font><br>
Da da. Da da da da da-daaaaaaaaa .... (all will become clear)</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Blueprint</b></font><br>
This month we give you the dirt on the background of the forthcoming <b>Jaws</b> from Screen 7.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Outlands</b></font><br>
Pherooawk! If you can't find something in this month's <i>Outlands</i> that you will want to rush out and purchase straight away, you're bloomin' bonkers. We've got Mr Money - alien cash-eating fiend from another dimension. We've got the Potato Clock - strange Irish timepiece. We've got two new vids to drool over. And we've even got The Horn. Confused? You should be!</p>

Sinclair User is a dangerously addictive magazine. Just how deep is your obsession with the best Speccy games mag in the galaxy? Use our special tester to find out if you're completely hooked.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Tank!</b></font><br>
Yes. Just when you thought we couldn't give away any more tanks, we're back with another &quot;How many rounds per minute can a Chieftain fire&quot; affair. Only this time it's a complete Panzer division we're giving away. There are lots of plastic self-assembly kits and the first prize is a smashing &#163;250 radio controlled tank that REALLY BLOWS THINGS UP and REALLY INVADES SMALL COUNTRIES (except it doesn't)</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Lot Of Decibels</b></font><br>
Virginmastertronic are releasing SILKWORM, this month's cover game. It's about a Helicopter and a Jeep scouring the countryside blowing the bottom off anything that gets in their way. &quot;So&quot;, we thought, &quot;What would be the most sensible prize to give away with such a game? Why, a huge Philips MIDI HI FI with CD and a load of Records, CDs and Tapes too, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Plus 3</b></font><br>
If you haven't bought yourself a +3 yet, this competition we're running with Gremlin is just the thing for you. In conjunction with the release of <b>Super Scramble Simulator</b> (reviewed elsewhere this ish) we've got a +3, some super games, T-shirts and the whole shooting match to give away, and the questions are so simple you'd have to Wayne's half-brother Duayne not to get them right.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Job!</b></font><br>
Jim wants a holiday and we need an EDITOR FOR A DAY! Boss people around. Shout down the telephone. Drink lots of coffee. Interested? Apply within ...</p>
