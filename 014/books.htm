<p class="first">MANY SINCLAIR owners are turning their attention to machine code and trying to program either in direct Z-80 low-level code or in assembly language. Publishers have also entered that area of the market and several good books have been produced.</p>

<p>Melbourne House has two new books which cover machine code and related subjects more than adequately. The first is by Dr Ian Logan, author of several books and pamphlets on the ZX81 ROM. <i>Understanding Your Spectrum</i> covers both Basic and machine code programming. Its aims are to show how the Spectrum works, to teach Z-80 machine code, and to give the reader an understanding of the ROM operating system in the machine. Logan does all those things in a very expert manner which even the beginner should understand.</p>

<img src="books.jpg" width=266 height=499 hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align="right" alt="">

<p>The other book from Melbourne House is <i>Spectrum Machine Language For The Absolute Beginner</i>. It is even easier to understand than Logan's. It starts from a very simple base and takes the reader through most of the Z-80 instruction set as implemented on the Spectrum.</p>

<p>The theory is supported by practical examples which can be entered and run by anyone. The book is completed by taking the reader from conception to the completion of an arcade game, Frogger, written all in machine code.</p>

<p>Both books are excellent in content but a little over-priced. <i>Understanding Your Spectrum</i> costs &#163;7.95 and <i>Spectrum Machine Language For The Absolute Beginner</i> &#163;6.95. If you are thinking of programming in machine code, the books will teach you almost everything you want to know.</p>

<p>A good alternative is <i>Introducing Spectrum Machine Code</i> by Ian Sinclair. It provides an easy introduction to machine code but does not offer so much in terms of content as the Melbourne House issues.</p>

<p>Sinclair begins by introducing the reader to ROM and RAM. He shows how both those systems are used to give the user an easy way of programming. He then provides a long discussion of Z-80 programming. The book is sprinkled adequately with examples and many of the machine code routines explained are put into Basic listings in the form of DATA, to allow the user to enter them quickly. <i>Introducing Spectrum Machine Code</i>, from Granada Publishing, costs &#163;7.95.</p>

<p>The range of books not aimed at a particular computer is growing. Several will prove useful to Sinclair owners.</p>

<p><i>Some Useful Basic Subroutines</i> again is written by Ian Sinclair. He uses MicroSoft-type Basic and some of the routines will need re-writing to work on Sinclair machines. The book would be of great value to ZX-81 users, as it includes Basic routines for flashing, scrolling and centring titles, underlining titles and sorting data. From Newnes Microcomputer Books, it is good value at &#163;4.95.</p>

<p><i>Get More From Your Personal Computer</i> is another title from Newnes. The author is Ian Hickman. It deals with the development of the computer, explains Basic programming and then the principles behind number systems, logic diagrams and, finally, machine code.</p>

<p>It works well as a general guide to the principles of computing and the way in which humans and computers interact. It costs &#163;5.95.</p>

<p>Another general book of interest to Sinclair users is <i>Programming With Graphics</i> by Garry Marshall. It takes the reader through the various types of graphics on computer systems - block, pixel and high resolution. There are also chapters dealing with the production of graphic displays, three-dimensional representation and animation.</p>

<p>For those wishing to produce arcade games or who want to demonstrate physics experiments on the screen, the book is ideal. If you want to know how those images on TRON were created, but at a much simpler level, you will get some idea from the book. It is available from Granada and costs &#163;5.95.</p>

<p><i>The Youngs Computer Register</i> for the ZX-80 and ZX-81 has just been republished. It now contains an extra supplement with invaluable information on the Sinclair market.</p>

<p>The guide lists the names and addresses of most software and hardware companies and also provides information on products. As with the previous issue, the register is split into sections for easy reference.</p>

<p>Together with the supplement, it can be obtained from Youngs Computer Publications for &#163;3.95. The supplement is also available separately for &#163;2.</p>

<p>The quality of books both in content and packaging is improving as the market expands. Computer books are now finding their way from the technical to the general sections of bookshops. That is a good move, as it will make more people aware of the computer market.</p>
