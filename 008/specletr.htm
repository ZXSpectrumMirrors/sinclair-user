<center><h1>Promises, promises ...</h1></center>

<p class="first">DURING the summer months there was a growing tide of anger and bitterness about the delays in delivery of the Spectrum. We have tried to keep readers informed of what has been happening and in return readers have been telling us their experiences.</p>

<p>For a short time in August the flow of complaints eased slightly but throughout September they streamed in again.</p>

<p>Rather than select portions from the letters and telephone messages, we decided it would be better for the readers to tell their stories in their own words.</p>

<p>As we report on page i, Sinclair Research is again confident that such problems as are related will not be experienced by many other people.</p>

<center><hr noshade width="50%"></center>

<p class="first">CONGRATULATIONS on <a href="../006/specusr.htm#anger">your expose of the anger</a> which has developed of the promise-with-no-performance by Sinclair about the Spectrum. I ordered mine in May and it had not been delivered by September, a 15-week delay. There had been various promises from time to time indicating that it would be coming shortly but they proved meaningless.</p>

<p>Irritation has been compounded first by the continued advertising promising a 28-day delivery and also by the various statements reported in the computer press saying that things would be normal shortly.</p>

<p>The latest in one paper was that the 28-day delivery would be achieved by the end of September. If they were still on 15 weeks in the first week of that month, this seems somewhat unlikely.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Spectrum might be re-christened the Mirage, as it appears to be an illusion?</p>

<p class="first"><a name="catherall">I</a> AM WRITING to express my frustration regarding my attempts to obtain a Spectrum. Whatever information the Sinclair organisation has released to yourselves, it certainly has not given it to one of its customers.</p>

<p>I ordered a 16K Spectrum via Teledata after checking specifically the delivery time at the beginning of June. On June 28 I received a letter from Sinclair informing me of a further six weeks' delay. Since then I have heard nothing.</p>

<p>Sinclair does not answer its telephone on 0276 685311, neither will it reply to letters, even though a s.a.e. is enclosed. Individual customers are powerless to obtain any service from it other than to cancel an order, an action Sinclair can safely gamble we will not do.</p>

<p>May I request that individually or collectively you take some action to move Sinclair from its complacent position? It is a tragedy that its technical achievements are not being supported by its customer service.</p>

<p class="first">I FELT I must write to tell you of my experience with Sinclair. I do not know who quoted the delivery claims such as &quot;New orders down to 28 days by the end of September&quot; but by my reckoning my 16K machine ordered at the end of June would arrive after those new orders.</p>

<p>After six weeks of waiting I received an &quot;It will be only another six weeks&quot; letter. Now after telephoning the despatch department I was told &quot;only another six weeks&quot;. I telephoned again and was told that delivery would be as per my 12-week letter, i.e., a total of 18 weeks from order date.</p>

<p>Anyway, at the beginning of September, at the opening of a new John Menzies store in Glasgow, I was assured by a Sinclair representative that I would have my machine within a week. What rubbish.</p>

<p>According to Sinclair's reckoning of delivery dates, I would get my machine more rapidly if I were to cancel and re-order at the end of September. I still wait - and wait and wait?</p>

<p class="first"><b>John Tobins, Glasgow.</b></p>

<p class="first">I WAS interested in <a href="../006/specusr.htm#anger">your news item of delays on delivery</a> in the September issue. I believe that my situation is even worse. I placed my order on May 15. I telephoned Sinclair at Camberley today to be told there was a minimum wait of another four weeks. I make that a minimum delivery of 22 weeks.</p>

<p>Do you offer prizes for the slowest delivery?</p>

<p class="first"><b>M R Lee</b></p>
	
<p class="first">I HAVE made enquiries about the &#163;10 voucher offered by Sinclair. It appears that the offer does not apply if you go to W H Smith or any other authorised dealers. I asked if I could be sent a printer with the Spectrum if I paid the price, then &#163;10, and I was told I could not change my order, so I have to make a new one. I would not get the &#163;10 off until the Spectrum is delivered.</p>

I wonder what Mr Sinclair is offering. To get a printer or a pack of two rolls of paper costs &#163;2.95 in postage. So the real value to the customer of the &#163;10 is only &#163;7.05.

<p>For all the aggravation the whole affair has caused and the many calls we had to make to discover what is happening, I think we deserve something more. I suggest that the RS232 network interface board would be a more appropriate compensation.</p>

<p class="first"><b>A I Toumazis</b></p>

<p class="first">SEEING YOUR <a href="../006/specusr.htm#anger">recent news headline</a> that anger is growing over delays in delivery of the Spectrum prompted me to write. After waiting 15 weeks, not the 12 widely quoted in the technical press, my Spectrum finally arrived.</p>

<p>It worked very well for four days and suddenly stopped, never to go again. I have returned it to Sinclair at a cost of &#163;2.35 and telephoned to find the turn-round time on repairs. My heart sank when I was told that they are not being repaired but I will be sent a new one, and I will join the queue again waiting for a new one.</p>

<p>Three to four weeks is quoted for delivery, which the company obviously cannot meet and I consider I have done my waiting already.</p>

<p>Needless to say I am furious and would cheerfully give Clive Sinclair a piece of my mind if I could get through to him.</p>
