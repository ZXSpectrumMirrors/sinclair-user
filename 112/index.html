<p class="first">It's THE biggest Tape in the Cosmos! Others cost more and give so much less? This month play the FULL GAMES: REVOLUTION, HIGHWAY 4, COLLISION COURSE, ANDROID 2, OUT FOR THE COUNT, HYPERPLANE (on the Enigma tape) and a special SU prize game, CEASEFIRE (details of how to get it are on page 7.) There's also the good ol' Captain Poke's POKES, and 'load-in' cheats with Tips Amazing.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Andrea Walker</b><br>
Our art editor has gone all farty this month. The culture vulture has been hanging out at posh cinemas that only screen subtitled films. &quot;French is in!&quot; she declared one Monday morning in what can only be described as &quot;shattered&quot; Franglais. Her desk is plastered with pin-ups of Hercule Poirot and Charles de Gaulle and she's programmed her Mac to play the Marseillaise at the touch of a button. (Any chance of an overseas transfer! Ed).<br>

<p class="first"><b>Chris Jenkins</b><br>
Mr Flash could be in danger of giving Spectrum games a good name this month. He's actually found some he likes! After the shocking news that, contrary to popular belief, he is conscious when he reviews a game, Chris has been approached by all manner of sponsors, desperate to lure the Hateful one into a deal. Not to promote their products, but to trash the oppositions! &quot;Now was that one or two b's in rubbish?&quot; - Chris.<br>

<p class="first"><b>Tony Naqvi</b><br>
The late Mr Naqvi, so-called because he'll be late, one day, is earning a reputation for punctuality. Never a second late, he shares a desk with Steve and the two have resorted to camping outside SU Towers in an early morning 9.29am race for the one chair that accompanies the workplace! At the moment Tony has the upper hand. Steve still can't tell the time!<br>

Garth has been really fed up this month. Some wag has been addressing all his mail Garth 'Stumpy' Sumpter! &quot;I am not short!&quot; he screams &quot;and if I find the joker they'll be eating through a straw!&quot; This may be the case, but the mysterious appearance of tacky platform shoe add-ons and rubber wedges around the under belly of his desk descry 'Midget!'. &quot;My mother warned me about leaving my greens&quot; he mumbles darkly as he climbs down from his editorial Mothercare car seat ...<br>

<p class="first"><b>Steve Keen</b><br>
Wahey! Another month and our new writer is still with us. I don't want to say that we have a high staff turnover at SU, but they come and go more often than the Pope changes his undies! Still he must be doing something right, he's been given his very own half desk, half phone, half chair and half console. Garth says it fits in well with his half brain. Your key to the executive wash room is safe for now, just make sure you don't have to share it with Garth 'cos he's ALL man!<br>

<p class="first"><b>Yvette Nichols</b><br>
SU's very own answer to the baby wars. (see the latest copy of YS - but don't buy it, just try a few bins), Yvette has brought a whole new style to the page design of SU. She says that because she's from New Zealand, she understands how to use shape and colour to create a lasting impression but we believe her impressionistic use of colour is more to do with bringing baby Damien into the office. He may look cute, but when Yvette's not looking I'm sure he spits Gerber's Mashed Banana Dinner for small Demons onto all the artwork ...<br>
