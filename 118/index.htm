<p class="first"><b>Garth Sumpter</b><br>
Oh dear, the fat old fool really has blown a sparky this month. After having spent most of his SU pocket money on his 37 visits to see Terminator 2, he has finally taken to walking around the office in his biker gear, shouting &quot;Come with me if you want to live&quot; and then shooting his publisher, Steve Keen, Big Al and even the lovely Andrea with a Nintendo light gun. This isn't too bad but his repeated pleas to lower him into some boiling metal is really getting on his nerves. Rumour has it that Steve Keen and Big Al have bought an industrial cauldron and are currently collecting scrap metal ...</p></td>

Not a man known for mincing his words (although his walk could do with some improvement), said &quot;Hasta La Vista&quot; to the Crew this month in a tearful farewell to the Spectrum market. His going will leave a big hole in the Crew but Big Al will be squeezing into the gap (bagels allowing) until a replacement can be found. Garth is apparently looking for a long-haired sheepdog with a liking for heavy metal, diet Coke and wearing peculiar tight trousers that make you walk funny ...</p></td>

Well, well, it seems that Garth's Terminator impersonation has just about annoyed everyone. Andrea has threatened to resign unless he keeps his nasty little pistol to himself! She did however give him some good advice about his pistol before her outburst. She suggested he should file off the sights, grease the outside of the barrel and file down any sharp edges. When Garth waved the gun in her face and asked if that would make him faster on the draw she calmly replied &quot;No, but it'll hurt you less when I ram the ruddy thing up your bottom!&quot;</p></td>

<p class="first"><b>Big Al Dykes</b><br>
The mad Irishman has really had a bad turn this month. Garth has taken to placing an apple on his head and shooting it off in a futuristic, Terminator come William Tell, kind of thing. So far Big Al has been lucky ... Garth hasn't missed any of the strange, large orangey yellow Irish apples that Alan has been sitting on his head. It's strange now that Halloween is over that his supply seems to be running short, and he's no longer bringing in Pumpkin Pie loaded with bagels for his lunch. Here we see him trying to persuade Garth to postpone his target practice until he can get to the fruit and veg shop ...</p></td>
