<h1>Sinclair service record</h1>

<p class="first">IS IT really the big demand for the QL which is causing the delays in delivery? If that were true, those orders which were within the estimated demand would have been met and there would be a number of QLs in the hands of users.</p>

<p>When my order was placed I was assured that delivery would be within 28 days; 14 days later I was advised, in writing, that the order was being processed for delivery, but the day after delivery should have been made I was informed, in writing, that delivery would be delayed until the end of June.</p>

<p>It would seem that Sinclair is somewhat careless concerning contracted obligations. If Sinclair is to be considered as trustworthy, it should be more forthcoming with information which must be accurate and credible.</p>

<p>Sinclair service is appalling. My Spectrum has been replaced several times and on the most recent occasion the need was very urgent but Sinclair refused to speed the extremely slow turnround time in its workshops; it would have paid me to have had the job done at an independent workshop.</p>

<p>After the Spectrum was eventually returned it was discovered that the Microdrive and Interface 1 had more bugs than a hedgehog's skin; again, help from Sinclair was conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p>The RS232 interface, part of Interface 1, is sending out spikes which upset the printer and the Microdrive snatched an almost completed tape out of the cassette and wound it round the mechanism; then I discovered that tapes processed on one Microdrive are not compatible with tapes loaded on another Microdrive - there seems to be a speed differential between different Microdrives. In a telephone conversation, a representative of Sinclair denied the possibility. Letters to Sinclair have not been answered, including a recorded delivery letter to Nigel Searle.</p>

<p>In the last two months my Spectrum, Interface 1 and Microdrive have cost more than the original purchase price of the equipment and caused considerable problems. My son was unable to submit his A level examination project by the due date and as a result may be unable to enter the A level computer studies examination this year. That is a most appalling consequence of using Sinclair equipment.</p>

<p>The Sinclair products are innovative and meet a particular market need and the QL would seem to be following that tradition but unless Sinclair puts its service department in order and tells the truth about broken contracts to supply QLs, it will eventually go into well-deserved oblivion. It is no wonder that foreign countries are making substantial inroads into British manufacturing and service industries.</p>

<h2>The long view</h2>

<p class="first">AS A ZX-81 owner for only four months I have noticed a fair sprinkling of complaints letters, aimed chiefly at the poor reliability record and poor back-up provided by Sinclair.</p>

<p>What long-term international future can there be for a firm with a questionable record of quality control? When the Japanese enter our market seriously I suspect many will feel a cold wind blow. My next computer may not be a Sinclair, despite my complete admiration for the capabilities and potential of my little ZX-81, simply because of mixed reliability and dismal service.</p>

<p>Sir Clive Sinclair is often quoted as saying that once a product is launched he loses interest in it. That is a dismissive insult to those who have placed their faith in his products. In an ever more competitive market that can only be described as a 'head-in-the-sand' attitude which has often led to U.K. firms losing valuable markets. To maintain the ZX-81 as the best beginners' micro I would add three modifications - some kind of colour capability; a revised keyboard - nothing too special, my Filesixty stick-on job is admirable and cheap; and Microdrive compatibility. The Spectrum does not need much work on it; just more quality - that word again and a decent keyboard. If Oric can do it and Timex can do it, why can't Sinclair?</p>

<p>The QL? Surely Sinclair has lost goodwill by marketing a machine which seems to be non-existent; not having the specification finalised at the launch; taking money without being able to provide the goods in the 28 days stipulated.</p>

<p>Like most readers of your magazine I would like Sinclair to be world-beaters and to remain world-beaters for years. That will not happen unless fundamental flaws in its operation are set to rights and only pressure from you and the customers can tell it when change or improvement is required.</p>

<h2>How many day's make 28?</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE been a reader of your excellent magazine for 18 months and owner of a Spectrum for 15 months. Your March magazine had <a href="../025/news.htm">an article entitled</a>, QL demand ... delays. That is an understatement. Within a day of Sir Clive's statement launching the QL I telephoned to order it. Three days later I paid &#163;407 for it - I did not know about the QLUB then. My cheque was cashed on February 1 and my VAT receipt dated February 13. I am still waiting. I understand no QLs have been despatched.</p>

<p>Yet in the advertisement/order form it stated &quot;Despatched within 28 days of your order.&quot; After endless telephone calls to Camberley and three letters to top management, all of which have failed to generate a response, I write hoping you can get a satisfactory answer from Sinclair Research. I even have a computer printed postcard dated February 7 saying &quot;your (QL) is being prepared for despatch.&quot; So much for computers.</p>

<p>Previously I waited patiently for 13 months for two Spectrum Microdrives. When they arrived nobody even said sorry.</p>

<h2>Politics and Sinclair User</h2>

<p class="first">AS A TEACHER and a Conservative supporter, I take exception to some of the remarks made in your April article, <a href="../025/sincvoy.htm">No Time For Complacency</a>. I cannot speak for the present Government but I would like to put my views as briefly as I can.</p>

<p>The profligate spending of the last Socialist Government, or &quot;Labour&quot; as it calls itself, for some unknown reason, left this country in a very difficult financial position. The International Monetary Fund had refused to lend it any more money because of the extravagant way in which it was spent and the Socialists had to impose a freeze on spending which affected education and other services very severely.</p>

<p>It has cost practically all the revenue from North Sea oil to pay the interest on that debt and pay off some of the blank cheques left behind when they were put out of office in 1979. Under their Minister of Education, none other than Mrs Shirley Williams who was then a Socialist, we suffered equally from shortages of books and materials at a time when schools were full. She was too busy trying to impose comprehensive education on all and sundry to bother about such mundane things.</p>

<p>The present Government has put things back into perspective. You just cannot go on spending other people's money for ever, soaking the &quot;rich&quot; - who are usually not Labour supporters - to give to those they consider are the &quot;poor&quot; - who are usually good Labour party members, otherwise they do not exist - forever. What happens when there are no more &quot;rich&quot;?</p>

<p>I bought a 48K Spectrum last July after a long wait until I could afford one, as I wanted to assess its capabilities as a teaching machine, which I found to be limitless. I also wanted to keep one step ahead of the little horrors I teach and to be able to hold my own in discussions. As I find it a pleasant relief from work and politics, I did not welcome the intrusion of this in your otherwise excellent magazine. I shall, of course, continue to read it, despite all.</p>

<p>I cannot afford many things just now, like a daisywheel printer to go with my Tasword II and replace my 30-year-old typewriter; I shall buy one when I can afford it. The Government would dearly love to issue each school with two dozen computers and keep them up to date but there is the debt to pay and all manner of pressure groups demanding their share of public funds which are only just beginning to exist again.</p>

<p class="first"><b>J R Murray-Bligh</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>The article discussed the speech made by the Junior Industry Minister, Mr John Butcher, in which he claimed the present Government has established a 'world lead' in educating the first generation of computer-literate school children. In view of the inadequate computer resources in today's schools, that claim should not be allowed to pass unchallenged.</i></p>

<h2>Running into problems</h2>

<p class="first">IN THE GAME Cross Country in the April issue there is a mistake at line 30. It should read &quot;PRINT AT 21, INT(RND*32)&quot;, not &quot;AT 21, INT(RND*31)&quot;. As the game is printed you can move the runner to column 31 and so avoid all the cows without moving again.</p>

<h2>Sadistic games</h2>

<p class="first">IN REPLY to <a href="../025/letters.htm#cockbill">the letter from John Cockbill</a> I regret to inform him that I, and probably many other readers, including the seven-year-old son of one of my friends, escaped from Atic Atac many months ago.</p>

<p>Aficionados of the game should not be misled by the clues he has given as the location of some of the door keys varies between games.</p>

<p>For a test of real skill I suggest the game designed by a sadist for play by masochists, i.e., Chuckie Egg. Levels 1-8 are comparatively easy and levels 9-16 where one has only to cope with the mad duck are also plain sailing. Levels 17-32 involving chickens and the mad duck are slightly more difficult.</p>

<p>The really sadistic element, however, appears at level 33, where the format is the same as for the previous eight levels but the speed of the chickens is increased. The main disadvantage to the game is the inability to save a successful run and as it takes me more than an hour to reach my current limit of level 40, I suffer from lack of practice at high speeds. Is there life beyond level 40?</p>

<h2>SO simple</h2>

<p class="first">IN REPLY to <a href="../025/letters.htm#cockbill">John Cockbill</a> - April issue - sadly he did not make history by cracking Atic Atac. I cracked it in 1983 - it was so simple I did not consider it worth writing about.</p>

<h2>Do not adjust your set?</h2>

<p class="first">I AM WRITING with reference <a href="../022/letters.htm#fuller">to a problem one of your readers had</a> with obtaining colour from a Spectrum on a Contec 14in. portable TV.</p>

<p>First remove the five screws from underneath the Spectrum casing and turn the computer upright. Then carefully lift the top part of the casing so that it is just clear of the circuit board. Move it down over the rest of the casing but do not stretch the keyboard ribbon cable. Between the ULA and PAL encoder are four adjustable screws, used to tune the two separate outputs of the ULA. Then connect the computer to the TV as normal and create a border and paper colour. It is important that you note the positions of the screws mentioned. Use a screwdriver to adjust the top three of those screws until the colours appear on the TV, starting with the resistor marked 2.2 Kr. If after a time the colour disappears, further adjustment is needed. The bottom screw may also be adjusted if necessary. If that method fails, return the screws to their original positions.</p>

<h2>The house is bugged</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE managed recently to get my hands on a copy of the long-awaited Jet Set Willy. This game struck me as an example of the very finest games design possible and is a good target for other software houses but I was rather annoyed to find that there are one or two severe bugs in it.</p>

<p>After playing the game for some time I found a room by the name of &quot;Dr Jones will never believe this&quot;.</p>

<p>From the time I left the room I found that unusual things began to happen in certain rooms. For a start, all the nasties in the chapel disappeared, the UFO in the bridge disappeared, and if you enter either the kitchen or the east wall base or inside the mega trunk one by one all your lives disappear.</p>

<p>Another rather less cataclysmic bug is that when on the rope hanging over the beach, if you swing until the rope is at full swing and then jump off, so that you hit the top of the screen, you suddenly re-appear half way under the sand. Surely this could be corrected?</p>

<p>Of course, I realise that Matthew Smith was under tremendous pressure to release the game and far be it from me to criticise someone of his skill and talent for writing brilliant games, but I think I would rather have waited a few more weeks for the builders to finish Willy's mansion before I bought it.</p>

<h2>Baddies are sdrawkcab</h2>

<p class="first">IN THE MARCH issue, <a href="../024/softwre.htm#seiddab">a review of 3D Seiddab Attack</a> from Hewson Consultants was given in Software Scene. The question was posed as to what Seiddab(s) are, as the game requires the commander to shoot them down.</p>

<p>I suggest you try reading the word backwards which may answer your question.</p>

<h2>Good service at a price</h2>

<p class="first">RECENTLY I had problems with my computer caused by a faulty interface and the slot bar was missing. It caused a series of faults which rendered the computer useless. Feeling depressed, I posted my Spectrum to a repair company on a Monday and had it back in good working order the following Friday, for &#163;16.10 inclusive.</p>

<p>I am sure most readers would benefit from the peace of mind of knowing that such good service is available. The company is Computa-Fix, Surrey.</p>

<h2>Yes, another program bug</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE been buying <i>Sinclair User</i> for the last few months and I have found it very enjoyable to read and to test the programs but in the February edition I found in the program Starship Epsilon a number of mistakes.</p>

<p>On line 1525 it stated Print &quot;(33*ISP)&quot; and it should have read Print &quot;(32*ISP)&quot; also inverted commas were missed at the end of the statements.</p>
