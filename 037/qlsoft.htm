<p class="first">THE NEED for machine code development software has brought a glut of assemblers onto the market. Following the release of competent packages from Computer One and Metacomco, Sinclair Research and Adder Publishing have got into the act.</p>

<p>Sinclair has taken on the <b>GST Assembler</b>, may be as reparation for not using the Company's 68K-OS as the QL operating system. As the assembler does not have an integrated editor it has been packaged with the Metacomco full screen editor. That provides facilities for entry of any ASCII text file so you can also use it to edit Basic programs.</p>

<p>The package contains a clone program to make a back-up copy but it can be used to clone any programs, unlike the clone facilities on the four Psion business packages.</p>

<p>If you boot up the package a command screen appears with options to load just the editor or assembler or load them into memory so that they are interchangeable.</p>

<p>The assembler is easy to operate once you get past the manual which is minimal and not recommended for the beginner. It is pocket-sized so you can read it anywhere - which you will need to do several times if you know little about assembler notation and the ways in which such a utility works.</p>

<p>The differences between the two parts of the package - editor and assembler - are distinct. At the start of both you can redefine the size and shape of the text window. Cursor control keys are used in the editor but a CON is required for the assembler.</p>

<p>All 68000 instructions can be used with the product which contains a series of impressive utilities to make life easier for the programmer. One such utility is the INCLUDE directive which enables you to link in other source file subroutines - macros - from microdrive as if they were part of the main source code.</p>

<p>The package includes facilities for conditional assembly instructions, symbol table listings and spooling to printer or microdrive. It does not, however, include sufficient monitor capabilities, a failing for which it is not alone. Add to that the difficulties of getting started because of the manual and you can see that the package has more than one rough edge.</p>

<p>The same is true of the <b>Adder QL Assembler</b>, although more so. It has an integrated monitor to and from which you can switch quickly. It also contains a help page. The manual is easier to understand than the one from Sinclair, though it contains less information.</p>

<p>Adder provides most of utilities available with the Sinclair product but seems to have designed the assembler with the beginner in mind.</p>

<p>If you are a fairly competent programmer and understand the technical terms of the trade then you should go for the Sinclair package. For beginners the Adder package is the best bet. You could, however, buy neither as the Metacomco package is still the best on the market.</p>

<p>TYPING Tutor is intended for people who want to start typing on the QL, with all eight fingers. The package provides an excellent piece of SuperBasic software which gives you tests of increasing complexity starting with the home positions on the keyboard and, in 10 lessons, moves through all types of letter combinations to the formation of simple sentences.</p>

<p>The main test display shows a schematic of a keyboard and, underneath, tells the typist which keys to press and a message which informs them whether they have pressed the correct key. If you press the wrong key the corresponding position on the schematic keyboard is circled and a warning beep is sounded, for those who have mastered the art of hearing QL sound.</p>

<p>At the end of each test you will be given a report on your speed, the number of errors which you have made and your accuracy, worked as a percentage. The timings given may be a little suspect as the program is written in Basic and, using the system clock, cannot give a completely accurate word per minute calculation, but the time error is not large enough to greatly alter your chances of becoming a whizz at the keyboard.</p>

<p>The QL keyboard is the other disadvantage in using <b>Typing Tutor</b>. The software could be treated more seriously if it was written for a machine such as the IBM PC or even the Commodore 64, but it is good fun and probably the first addictive program for the QL. <b>Typing Tutor</b> on the QL can be compared with the popular IQ and psychology tests of which schools are so fond.</p>

<p>If you want a bit of fun with a reasonable piece of software buy <b>Typing Tutor</b>, but if you want to test your pinkies on a keyboard get an IBM PC or, better still, a typewriter.</p>
