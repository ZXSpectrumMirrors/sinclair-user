<p class="first"><font size="-1">As <b>Sinclair User</b>'s pioneer of New Technology, Jim is completely at home with thousands of pounds worth of high quality laser equipment. On top of deciding what goes in the mag, Jim can explain to the simplest of simpletons the pica/point conversion system on a Mac hard drive DTP 123 system. And not once has he sat and stared and sworn at a blank screen for a whole afternoon. Not many.</font></p>

<p class="first"><font size="-1">Alison loves her PC to PIECES (arf). With its special ergonomic vertical keyboard and - rather expensive - blank-o-screen Alison's Cray XMP Wysiwig can spell check, delete lines, write extra copy and even sample the current text and suggest a witty headline. Never again will you find a typographical error in <b>Sinclair User</b>. For example, the Cray has written the next piece.</font><br>

Descended from 11th century monks, Tim continues to keep some of their practices alive in his design work. Every letter that appears in all of the 120,000 issues printed each month is carefully printed on to each page by Tim using an Ivory stencil. Here Tim can be seen working on his 53,000th &quot;E&quot;. As you can see, it's fascinating work.</font></p>

You see, if he's not writing something at his desk, he's looking at a new game, and if he's not looking at a new game, he's trying to get hold of a new game, and if he's not trying to get hold of a new game, then he's driving thousands of miles to research some information on a new game that may be coming out. And of he's not doing any of that, he's probably completing his work for the CIA. Alright for some eh?</font></p>

<p class="first"><b>Cabal</b> is a seriously tough piece of code. There are villages to destroy, governments to overthrow, peasants to liberate and grenades to eat. We reckon <b>Cabal</b> could well take the throne from <b>Operation Wolf</b> as the most realistic and hair raising combat coin-op conversion. Were we right? Check out the review.</p>

Some of it we can tell you now; <b>Ghouls and Ghosts</b> is a spooky thing from US Gold. Another thing we know; <b>Galaxy Force</b> is a zappy, 3-D-ish spacey thing from Activision. But to preserve the mystery that is <i>Previews</i> we're going to make you turn to the feature to find out the rest! (Did that sound as if we know how we're going to fill up the space? - JD.

This year's PC Show is going to be really different. No it isn't, we're lying. It's going to be the same madhouse of weebling games and blathering businessmen as ever before, but this year we have the SU/US Gold Hypercard to make it even more crazy! Find out just how to use it, and you  could win mountains of software, or a Plus 3, or an Indiana Jones leather jacket, and you can get dosh off the entry fee too!!</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Poster</b></font><br>
Skyborne adventure in the year 2099 as <b>Mr Hell</b> does battle with the evil Muddy and his vicious followers! Pull your poster out, stick it on your wall, marvel at the airbrushing skill of Firebird's pet artist. Then run around your bedroom shouting WHIRR WHIRR WHIRR until you're blue in the face.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Blueprint</b></font><br>
Just how hot can you expect a <i>Blueprint</i> to be? How about <b>Powerdrift</b>, the arcade road-racing game which Nigel Mansell wet himself with fear? We've got all the facts and figures - how they did the graphics, how they did the sound, and how they crammed it all into a Spectrum without bursting.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Outlands</b></font><br>
Get FAT with SU! This month we've got the hot poop on the latest food fad to hit Britain - Jelly Beans. No ordinary jelly beans, these. You can mix and match and eat them in combination with each other to produce amazing oral delights. We also give you a run down on those fluorescent wallets that Tim and other Hep Cats are so keen on.</p>
