<img src="index1.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Good grief, he's looking pretty manky this month, eh readers? Poor Jimbly has been struck by the dreaded Flu epidemic. He's almost overdosed on Chloraseptic and is feeling very sorry for himself, and would like someone to give him a cuddle, please. Eurgh yuk, go away drippy bogey snout.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Al &quot;Super Fit&quot; Skeat</b><br>
<img src="index2.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Big Al's looking well smug with herself as she's the only one who's managed to avoid the lurgie. That's because she's been holed up in her Michael Jackson-style oxygen tent munching on garlic pills and Haliborange tablets. But naughty Oz has set about her bubble with his designer scalpel and all the germies are getting in, tee hee. Somebody pass Al the Junior Disprin please.</font></p>

<img src="index3.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">After a major bout of Christmas jollies, poor Garfy is certainly a wee bit worse for wear. Jim made him attend every software house chrimbo do because the rest of us were too &quot;ill&quot; to go, but it looks like he had a few too many beakers of Um Bongo. Quick lads, abandon the loo, here he comes.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Osmond &quot;Wibbly Limbs&quot; Brown</b><br>
<img src="index4.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Poor little Ossie. Wicked Uncle Jim has been working him so hard, that he's delivered a rather severe case of Designer's elbow. He's been scribbling away so hard that both of his elbows have turned to gungy runny stuff and his arms have gone all loppy. What a shame, looks like he's headed for the municipal home for crumbly old clapped out designers.</font></p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Quasar Special</b></font><br>
Ever played Combat Zone, where you splish around in a forest, shooting people with paint? Well, we've got something even better in the shape of the Quasar Centre. You don't know what that is do you?</p>

Blast out your eardrums with the sooper dooper hi-fi thingy on offer from US Gold in their Black Tiger Crossword competition. The temptations we have to withstand in order to just give away these fantastic objects each month are incredible.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Ferrari</b></font><br>
As if you hadn't read it before. Actually, these five model Ferraris are really rather super. They're finely detailed metal models of the F40 supercar. Even the steering wheel works.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Metal Goblin</b></font><br>
Lots of lovely little metal creatures are sitting in the fairy grotto which is Uncle Jim's desk drawer just waiting for a lick of paint.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Ferrari</b></font><br>
We're not going to pretend that we're offering real Ferraris, because every other magazine says pathetic things like that don't they? They're remote controlled dooberrys, so you either want one or you don't, OK?</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Win A Diving Suit</b></font><br>
We've all tested it out by backstroking through a few puddles in Farringdon Lane to make sure it works, and it does.</p>
