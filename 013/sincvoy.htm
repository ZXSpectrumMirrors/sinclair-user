<h1>A year ago this month</h1>

<p class="first">A YEAR AGO the first issue of <i>Sinclair User</i> was published to meet the demand from a growing number of owners of Sinclair ZX-80 and ZX-81 machines. As it was a new market, the first moves were cautious and only 32,000 were printed of that first issue. It sold out and the success of <i>Sinclair User</i> was assured.</p>

<p>We thought of marking our first anniversary with a special magazine but then realised that the formula which had made us successful should be disturbed only for an especially major event. Though our first birthday is important, it is not important enough to stop the regular flow of news, views and reviews.</p>

<p>Thus we have limited its mention to the columns of Sinclairvoyance and a special anniversary offer on the price of the ZX printer.</p>

<p>We have taken the opportunity, however, to change the style of presentation of articles. We have done so because, despite the increasing size of the magazine, important items have still had to be omitted or postponed because of the lack of space. The new format will allow us to put more information on to each page.</p>

<p>During our first year we received many complimentary comments from readers and advertisers. From the large number of letters we can quote from only a few but typical of the things you have had to say about us are those printed here.</p>

<p>Derek Reid from Dublin writes: &quot;I must congratulate you on publishing such a good magazine. The articles are very interesting and the reviews and programs are excellent.&quot;</p>

<p>Sheldon Kenton of Surrey had this to say: &quot;Before I had my ZX-81 I had already been buying <i>Sinclair User</i> for three issues and was very impressed with what I saw. I also found your Starting from Scratch articles extremely useful&quot;.</p>

<p>Our advertisers similarly have been keen to express their appreciation.</p>

<p>&quot;Our recent advertisements in <i>Sinclair User</i> have proved so successful that I have now shelved all plans for advertising in any other magazine,&quot; was the view of Bob Benchley of R and R Software.</p>

<p>Dave Looker of DJL Software made the following comment: &quot;I never cease to be amazed by the world-wide coverage provided by your magazine.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally Nigel Searle, managing director of Sinclair Research had this to say. &quot;As reflected by the extraordinary growth in its circulation <i>Sinclair User</i> has met a significant need among our customers for a constant flow of product information and applications and, on its first anniversary, we wish it continued growth and success.&quot;</p>

<p align="center" class="first"><img src="../shared/images/sincvoyb.jpg" width=450 height=97 border=0 alt=""></p>

<p>We have, of course, had our critics, particularly about the program listings. Since obtaining our dot matrix printer we have improved the listings for the ZX-81 programs and we will be doing the same for the Spectrum when a Centronics interface is available.</p>

<p>All the other criticisms are examined and we are always interested to consider ways of improving our service to readers. Our most recent recruits have been Quentin Heath and Zak. Heath has taken over the Mind Games column from Philip Joy and Zak draws our cartoon strip, Sinclair Simon. Both are interested in hearing your views.</p>

<p>There have been many changes in the Sinclair market during our first year, all of them connected with the growing popularity of home computing and the leading position of the Sinclair machines. Many of the small companies which began providing software and hardware add-ons as a sideline have found business so good that they have started doing the work full-time and are finding ever more complicated ways of using the deceptively small machines.</p>

<p><i>Sinclair User</i> has been recording those changes and trying to reflect the wide demands of a market which is becoming increasingly sophisticated. We think the mix of programs, news of new products and the latest developments in the market, along with advice on how to obtain the most from your machine and items of general interest, is about correct.</p>

<p>We are concerned, however, to improve the service we can offer and decided to set up the <i>Sinclair User</i> Road Show. It will be based on the usual stand we have had a number of shows in the last year, at which we have sold magazines and displayed some of the games we have published.</p>

<p>The major addition will be a series of problem-answering sessions by some of our contributors. Readers will be able to visit us with their difficulties, be they hardware or software, and we will give any advice we can.</p>

<p>We shall be testing the idea at the Bristol Hobbyist Fair being held on Saturday, March 19.</p>

<p>On the wider Sinclair market it is doubtful if our second year will be dominated by one event in the way that the Spectrum dominated our first. Despite having launched a new computer in each of the last three years, it is unlikely that Sinclair Research will follow that again this year.</p>

<p>The planned portable machine is not expected to be ready until next year, when the technology of the flat-screen television and the Microdrive will have been fully tested. One possible expansion is that the machine being developed for the U.S. market, the TS 1500, an improved ZX-81, might be sold here.</p>

<p>Of more immediate interest is the long-awaited Microdrive. As mentioned in our news pages, it has been further delayed. Early April is the latest date which was being talked about but that is already three months behind the original final date given when it was first announced last April.</p>

<p>It is understood that the latest problem relates to the type of tape being used. It is thought that the original tape which was believed to be suitable has shown signs of stretching.</p>

<p>No doubt this year there will be a number of competitors arriving. The Oric is already here and appears to be doing well, along with the Dragon. As for the others, we shall wait and see if they can begin production in the numbers necessary to provide a real challenge to the established leader.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we promise to continue to provide all the information you want on the Sinclair scene.</p>
