<p class="first">The Untouchables. Well, what can we say. Well, frankly we've run out of things to say. The big box full of &quot;Good words meaning &quot;Great&quot;&quot; has been completely emptied this month during the various articles about <i>The Untouchables</i>. Look, just take our word for it; this is simply the best conversion of any movie you've ever seen in your life. It's mega. Check it out, and read all about the movie too.</p>

Also you've find a playable demo of The Untouchables on side B. In case you hadn't realised (what are you, stupid?) there's a second tape this month. To find out exactly how to sample the delights from this one, you need to turn to the same page.</p>

<i>Myth</i> is probably one of the smartest pieces of programming around at the moment. Believe me, we're talking high-res multi colour graphics, ultra smooth animation and a great storyline. It's exploration on the grandest scale. Take a gander at these pages and you'll see how the programmers found ways round tricky problems and you'll get to see how that made the game look so damned good.</p>

The right shape. Everything. And are we charging you&#163;300,000 for it? No. we ain't charging you nowt.</p>

A fine event this month. Indeed, possibly the most exotic blend of herbs and spices and features ever to come together in two pages. Possibly not. This month, we've got a sneaky look at a couple of videos that are lurking just at the back of your local rental shop as well as the essential breakdown of the hep school gear. We'll also let you in on a set of items which will make you the biggest smart alec your class has ever seen.</p>
