<p class="first">Disc interfaces for the Spectrum tend to fall into one of two categories. They are either super-fast with all the facilities you could want - and some you don't - or they are plodders.</p>

<p>The SPD1 from LMT Computers falls into the second category. It can load and save Basic, Code and Data and do all the things that you'd expect from a disc interface. All the commands are built into the ROM and if you want to get fancy there are very rudimentary random access commands which let you read and write a sector on the disc.</p>

<p>One unusual feature is that, like the BBC, it treats each side of a disc as a separate drive. Although you can get less on a side - 182.5K with an 80-track drive - moving files around is easier.</p>

<p>If that were all it could do, it would hardly stand out from all the other disc interfaces for the Spectrum, but it has a number of features which make it particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Most important of those is the parallel printer port which can drive a range of full-sized printers. Once the port is initialised you can use LPRINT and LLIST to send text to the printer or use COPY* to copy the screen to an Epson-compatible.</p>

<p>Next there is a Magic Button which can be used to transfer your programs to disc. When the button is pressed the entire contents of memory - all 48K - is saved. When this is loaded back the program continues from the point it was saved.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a utility disc with a number of useful routines, an elementary word processor, a database and a Renumber facility. Two other programs on the disc allow for elementary networking to two SPD1s.</p>

<p>LMT will shortly be bringing out an upgrade board for the SPD1 that gives it proper networking - well, compatible with Interface 1 anyway - which should prove useful for schools. All this adds up to a useful package at a very reasonable &#163;89.95. The upgrade board will be &#163;29.95, or &#163;109.95 for the complete unit.</p>
