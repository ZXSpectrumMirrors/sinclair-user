<h2>Issue 87<br>June 1989</h2>

<p class="first"><b>It's the SU All Stars! Yaaaaay!</b></p></center>

<p class="first"><center><b>Jim &quot;The Natural&quot; Douglas</b><br>
<img src="index1.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">A born superstar. Playing for the Boston Redsox team in the 1947 world series, Jim received a near-fatal injury at the hands of a jealous female fan. While details are a little fuzzy, it's known that Jim spent twelve years in traction and psychotherapy after the incident. Now a coach with many youth teams across the States, he makes regular appearances in game shows and sports quiz programmes in the US. He has been paralleled with Emlyn Hughes. Once.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Alison &quot;Tin-legs&quot; Skeat</b><br>
<img src="index2.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">In shock developments this month, motorcycle stunt racer Skeat was both involved in a horrific accident during a display and a ghastly mix-up in the resulting hospital visit. After weeks of plastic surgery, it became clear that something was wrong with the very nature of Alison's appearance. Is there any hope left? Er, no.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Tim &quot;Slugger&quot; Noonan</b><br>
<img src="index3.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">From the wrong side of the tracks, the boy with the Golden Gloves came to prominence in the late 50s. Noonan made a name for himself throughout the boxing world as one of the worst fighters ever to be allowed in the ring. While finding much public support, Noonan unfortunately received such a pasting in his much publicised fight with Clubber Paris, he was forced to retire from boxing for good and took up a position running an occupational therapy daytime care centre for the slightly bewildered. His first book of poetry is due to be reprinted next month.</font></p>

<p class="first"><center><b>Chris &quot;Black Avenger&quot; Wilkins</b><br>
<img src="index4.jpg" width=100 height=100 hspace=10 vspace=5 border=0 alt=""></center></p>
<p class="first"><font size="-1">Jenkins was trained by Shaolin monks after being discovered in a pile of noodles at the back of a Chinese takeaway in Gerrard St. Now he runs his own martial arts centre in the mountains of South Wales. Described by himself as &quot;the most dangerous man alive&quot;, he can break a plank of wood with a sledgehammer, can withstand hours of slight chilliness and can runs as fast as someone else who can't run very fast. Truly, a force not to meddle with.</font></p>

<p class="first">Is good, yes? Well, you'll have to read the review to find out, 'cos we're not telling you here. But let's face it, a game featuring the hardest man in the galaxy, rivalled only by Dribbling Mad Gnasher Norman the Art Ed. with huge sprites (fyak) and more punching than a queue for the fag counter at Tesco's can't be all bad.</p>

<p class="first">ELECTROBINGO IS HERE! Turn to the feature now in order to learn how you can use the mystical number you've found nestling just beneath Arnie's nose. It could well be your passport to a glorious life on a tropical island, well, alright, it could well be your passport to a life of astounding gamesplaying with Miles Gordon's amazing SAM supercomputer.</p>

<p class="first">There's also information about the rest of this month's all-star tape line-up. There are two demos - an all-action combat space game and a rough and tough footy extravaganza. And there's a fantastic complete game written specially for us by Players that'll blow your socks off.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Ask The Imbeciles</b></font><br>
Hello, good evening and welcome to our most surreal feature yet. We long for those heady days of yesteryear when the Gorgeous Robert Robinson polished his pate and presented quizzes of skull-fracturing dullness. In a tribute to such bygone days we ask you ... what do you think this object is?</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Poster</b></font><br>
Pheeeew! Here's a saucy one for the girls (wot girls? - Ed). It's our glorious technicolour <b>Navy Moves</b> poster, celebrating the release of <b>Navy Moves</b> from Spanish software geniuses Dinamic. It's brilliant, and we don't care who knows it.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Outlands</b></font><br>
It's back back BACK! The pages that haven't been seen since the last issue ride into town, get off their horses, stride through the swing doors of the saloon and order a glass of milk. This month we've got everything from a new line in rubber toys (ferr-yak!) through Compact Disc Video, Comedy Vids and, of course, sunglasses.</p>

<p class="first"><font size="+1"><b>Back Issues</b></font><br>
Not, as you may think, the dullest page in the whole magazine. No! It's actually a chance for you to get a copy of <b>Sinclair User</b> that you may have missed out on in previous months. And most  importantly, you can complete your set of Megatapes.</p>
