<p class="first">CHRISTMAS IS traditionally a time for looking back at events of the past year and that is the theme of Mind Games this month.</p>

<p>You will have an opportunity to do some work for a change to see how good you are at adventure games. The puzzles are a jumble of traditional quizzes and brainteasers together with the practical applications of gaming illustrated in Mind Games earlier this year. Do not worry if you come across a problem that you cannot solve, hints will be given, sometimes as to where you can find the solution.</p>

<p>When you have done your best then <a href="mindgmsa.htm">consult the answers</a> to find how many you solved correctly. Then turn to the Gold Points section on this page and discover your mind game percentage score.</p>

<h2>QUESTIONS</h2>

<p class="first"><b>1. Character Attributes.</b> In the <a href="../031/mindgms.htm">October issue</a> we discussed how characters within adventures can be created by setting up emotional and physical attributes within a matrix. Two matrices were given for characters showing their endurance, strength, lawful, and intelligence traits. Each of those were given a score between -10 and +10 where a positive sign showed the existence of that trait and negative sign showed the opposite of that trait. For instance, if Strength was -5 the character would be a weakling.</p>

<p>The two characters below are about to perform two actions. Firstly, they are going to argue. The loser of the argument will start a fight. Who is the loser of the argument and who wins that fight?</p>
