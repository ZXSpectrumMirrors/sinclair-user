<h1>Doubt over accuracy test</h1>

<p class="first">IN HIS <a href="../005/letters.htm#campbell">letter in the August issue</a>, M Campbell refers to the consecutive application of sin, cos, tan, arctan, arccos, and arcsin - to get back to the original value - as a check for the accuracy of a calculator in handling trigonometric functions.</p>

<p>That artificial test is not a good one as it can give poor results with calculators which are satisfactory for handling complex trigonometric functions in real problems. Campbell quotes a half percent error on Casio calculators and 33 percent error on Sinclair calculators. Using a starting value of pi/4 (45 deg.) my 100-step programmable Novus calculator does not even complete the sequence as an intermediate result is outside the permitted range of the argument for the next function.</p>

<p>When that test is applied to the ZX-81 your correspondent states: &quot;You will be amazed and aghast alternately at the results&quot;.</p>

<p>You may be amazed, because the ZX-81 has a much better calculating ability than most desk calculators, but you should not be aghast unless you overlook the argument and result ranges for which the functions are valid.</p>

<p>For example, sin pi/4, sin 3pi/4 and sin 9pi/4 all give the value 0.70710678 (SQR 2)/2) but arcsin 0.70710678 gives pi/4 (0.78539816) because the result of arcsin must be one value and is therefore limited to the range -pi/2 to pi/2.</p>

<p>If the sin cos sequence is started with 3pi/4, it will finish with pi/4.</p>

<h2><a name="gross">Rooting for family trees</a></h2>

<p class="first">I SHOULD be grateful if you would let me know if there is any software suitable for recording family trees designed for ZX-81 plus 16K RAM. I may be wrong but I think there may be more to such a program than a simple recorded list.</p>

<p class="first"><b>L Gross</b></p>

<p class="first"><i>We have not seen any programs for family trees but perhaps readers might be able to help.</i></p>

<h2>Program points cleared</h2>

<p>I READ your magazine with interest and always try the programs in it. Only about four out of every five work; for instance, Tim Crossley's program for Snap contained several errors. First, I believe line 110 should read: 110 IF INT(C/2)=C/2 THEN LET B=18.</p>

<p>Also if Bar is printed after the word cherry, you get a new word - BARRRY. Inserting the line:</p>

<pre>120 PRINT AT .O.0,B;A$; &quot;   &quot; (3 spaces)</pre>

<p class="first">instead of line 120 deals with the problem.</p>

<p>One of the problems for any magazine is the general printing of the programs. I know that the quality of some printers is not 100 percent but I am sure bad lines could be printed again, in clear letters. Take for instance Tim Crossley's program again; I could not tell what line 110 read - the first + , if it is a plus, which I believe is &quot;=&quot;, is very confusing.</p>

<h2>Black Jack error code</h2>

<p class="first">IN PUBLISHING my letter regarding Black Jack in the June issue, an error crept into lines 20 and 50. They should read:</p>

<pre>LET CA=INT (RND*13)+2</pre>

<p class="first"><b>Ted Maynell</b></p>

<h2>Adding 16K can be easy</h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE read that if a program has been SAVED by a computer with only 1K RAM and subsequently a 16K RAM has been added the 1K program could not be re-loaded without removing the memory expansion.</p>

<p>I have found, on my ZX-81 at least, that is not true. You simply load the program, run it once, 'break' it and run it again. It should work perfectly.</p>

<p>I have bought every issue of your magazine and I think it is great.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Andrew Smith</b></p>

<h2>Plea for notes on listing</h2>

<p class="first">I LIKE your magazine very much; I find it very helpful. There is still a great deal which I find very baffling but that is probably my fault. I have tried some of your programs but the clarity is not very good.</p>

<p>In a program there must be notes on what the lines do, so if there are variables which can be changed to alter speed and numbers, I can do so. It helps if I could be told whether to make them smaller or larger; I find that an easier way of learning programing than wading through handbooks and their useless examples.</p>

<h2>Delivery difficulties</h2>

<p>I SOMETIMES have problems obtaining Sinclair User. Could you inform me where I can buy it?</p>
